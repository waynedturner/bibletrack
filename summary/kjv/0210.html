      3 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. <br>
      4 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: <br>
      5 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. <br>
      6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: <br>

      <p><font size="3"><b>Matthew's account is more abbreviated than Luke's.</b> Matthew's account goes to the bottom line of the words exchanged between Jesus and the Roman centurion (a Gentile). We find from Luke's account that the words were actually exchanged through messengers because the centurion did not feel worthy to address Jesus personally. It would appear that Luke wants to emphasize the extreme respect the centurion had for Judaism by not wanting to compromise Jesus' testimony (in hanging out with a Gentile); you will recall the outrage of the Pharisees when Jesus went to Matthew's house where Gentiles were present in <a title="Matthew 9, Mark 2 and Luke 5 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=1&dy=25#Jews" target="_blank">Matthew 9:9-13; Mark 2:14-17; Luke 5:27-32 (see notes)</a>. This conversation between Jesus and the centurion actually takes place in two waves - the first group of messengers in verse 3, &quot;he sent unto him the elders of the Jews.&quot; Capernaum is in northern Israel on the north side of the Sea of Galilee, so these were probably not the Jerusalem leaders of the Jews, but local leaders in Capernaum. Since this centurion had been so considerate of the Jews there (even built them a synagogue), they declare this Gentile worthy of a miracle from Jesus (verses 4-5). Jesus heads for the centurion's house.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Not far from the house, the centurion sends out a second set of messengers (akin to attorneys speaking on one's behalf) to talk with Jesus. These representatives are the ones to whom Jesus talks on behalf of the centurion. The centurion compares Jesus' power over sickness to his own power over his troops. <b>He tells Jesus that all he needs to do is speak, and his servant will be healed. Jesus expresses his delight over this man's grasp of faith.</b> Here's a Gentile who exercises more faith than those Jews to whom Jesus has come as Messiah. Then Jesus makes an interesting statement in Matthew 8:11-12</font> &quot;And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. But the <b>children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness</b>: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot; He points out that, <b>while Jews</b> (&quot;children of the kingdom&quot;)<b> will reject him, Gentiles will come from all parts of the world to acknowledge Jesus as Messiah.</b> Isaiah had prophesied that the millennium will consist of Jews and Gentiles alike (<a title="Isaiah 55-56 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=10&dy=09#Gentiles" target="_blank">Isaiah 55-56, see notes</a>), a prophetic doctrine that the Jewish leaders weren't too crazy about.</p></td>

		<p><font size="3">The day following the healing of the centurion's servant, Jesus is about 15 miles southwest of the Sea of Galilee in northern Israel in the city of Nain. Luke is careful to point out (as he frequently does) the large crowd who is following Jesus. A funeral procession goes by, and Jesus has compassion on the widow woman whose only son was in the open coffin; he touches the coffin and says, &quot;Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.&quot; The young man sits up in the coffin and begins to speak. Luke points out in verses 16-17 that the people were subsequently very enthusiastic regarding the ministry of Jesus, acknowledging him as &quot;a great prophet.&quot; This certainly must have reminded them of Elijah (<a title="I Kings 17 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=26#Lodges" target="_blank">I Kings 17:17-24, see notes</a>) and Elisha (<a title="II Kings 4 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=1#Barren" target="_blank">II Kings 4:18-37, see notes</a>) when they had worked similar resurrection miracles.</font></p>

      6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. <br>
      7 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? <br>
      8 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings&#146; houses. <br>

      11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. <br>

    <td align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#cce1ff"><font size="2">18 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. <br>

      21 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight. <br>
      22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached. <br>

    <td><p><font size="3">John the Baptist is in prison, so he sends a couple of his disciples to check Jesus out; who is he? As an interesting aside, John had baptized Jesus and saw the miracle that took place at Jesus' baptism. </font>However, <b>while John suspects that Jesus is the Messiah, John wants a confirmation.</b> It appears that <b>John's disciples show up when Jesus is surrounded by a crowd of seekers AND scoffers</b>. John's disciples ask Jesus this question, <b>&quot;<font color="black">Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?&quot;</font></b><font color="black"> Inquiring minds want to know. So, how is Jesus going to sufficiently answer John's disciples without directly proclaiming himself the Messiah before the hostile Jewish leaders there who are just waiting for him to utter words that can be used as evidence of blasphemy. Well, it's simple for Jesus. First of all, <b>he immediately begins healing the people in the multitude and tells John's disciples to report this to John. John's a smart man; he will immediately relate these actions to the prophesied actions of the Messiah in <a title="Isaiah 61 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=10#Messianic" target="_blank">Isaiah 61</a></b><a title="Isaiah 61 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=10#Messianic" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> </font>You may recall that a year (perhaps as much as two) earlier, Jesus introduced his Messianic ministry up in Nazareth when he read this very same Old Testament passage in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=1&dy=21#Jews" title="Luke 4 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 4:18-19 (see notes)</a> regarding the miracles that would be performed during the ministry of the Messiah. However, in that passage, Jesus concluded in Luke 4:21 by saying, &quot;This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.&quot; While he doesn't read Isaiah 61 on this occasion, he does refer to the Messianic activity outlined there. <font color="black">In other words,<b> &quot;Yes!&quot;</b></font> </p>
      <p>After John's disciples leave, Jesus continues with a startling announcement to those who surrounded him, &quot;I am the Messiah.&quot; But he doesn't say it in a way that can be used as evidence against him by the Jewish leaders. He says of John in verse <font color="black">27, &quot;This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.&quot; <b>That's a quotation from </b><a title="Malachi 3 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=30#John" target="_blank"><b>Malachi 3:1</b> (see notes)</a> proclaiming that a prophet will precede the Messiah, and that prophet is John the Baptist. It is interesting to note that <b>later on when Jesus is asked about whether or not John is the fulfillment of Malachi's prophecy, Jesus says, in essence, he could have been.</b> You see, Malachi's prophecy looked all the way into the millennium. <b>Had the Jews received Jesus as the Messiah, he would have been the fulfillment of Malachi's prophecy; but since they did not, he was not the fulfillment of that prophecy.</b> Jesus said this when asked about this matter in <a title="Matthew 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=10#John" target="_self">Matthew 11:14 (see notes)</a> &quot;And if ye will receive it, this is Elias (Elias=Elijah), which was for to come.&quot; He further adds in <a title="Matthew 17 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=22#Sign" target="_blank">Matthew 17:10-13 (see notes)</a> &quot;And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. But I say unto you, <b>That Elias is come already, and they knew him not,</b> but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font color="black">Now here's the big caveat: Daniel had prophesied that the Messiah would be &quot;cut off&quot; in <a title="Daniel 9 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=12#Weeks" target="_blank">Daniel 9:26 (see notes)</a>, and Isaiah had prophesied that the Messiah would be rejected by the Jews in <a title="Isaiah 52-53 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=7#Salvation" target="_blank">Isaiah 52-53 (see notes)</a>. <b>When John the Baptist and Jesus came, the Jews did have an opportunity to receive Jesus as their Messiah and usher in the rule of Israel over the earth under the Davidic throne.</b> It had been prophesied that they would reject, and Christ knew that in advance as well (of course he did). Therefore, <b>John the Baptist would have fulfilled the Malachi prophecy had the Jews readily accepted the Messiah</b>, but they did not...<b>so John, consequently, was not Elijah.</b> As it turns out, Elijah does, in fact, appear prior to the second coming of Jesus Christ in <a title="Revelation 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=19#Witnesses" target="_blank">Revelation 11:3 (see notes)</a>, and this event will fulfill the criteria referenced by <a title="Malachi 4 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=30#Elijah" target="_blank">Malachi 4:5 (see notes)</a>.

      <p>So, when the day was over, how did the Jewish leaders respond to Jesus? <a title="Luke 7 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=10#John" target="_blank">Luke 7:30 (see notes)</a> sums it up, &quot;<font color="black">But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.&quot; Of course, what did we expect? But they did walk away without evidence to convict Jesus of anything. It is further interesting to notice that Luke tells us in verse 29, &quot;And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.&quot; It was only the self-centered Jewish leaders that rejected. <b>Hey! Did you catch that phrase? Notice again the words, &quot;being baptized with the baptism of John.&quot; </b>The Greek verb translated in the KJV &quot;being baptized&quot; there is an aorist passive participle. Being aorist and passive in form, it points to a time when these folks had been baptized by John's baptism, and is probably best understood as &quot;having been baptized.&quot; There is no real indication that baptizing with John's baptism was done on this particular day. </font></p>
      <p><font color="black">John the Baptist's description of his baptism is found in <a title="Matthew 3 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=1&dy=13#Baptized" target="_blank">Matthew 3:11 (see notes)</a>, &quot;<b>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance:</b> but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: <b>he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.</b>&quot; This projected baptism was first initiated on the Day of Pentecost after the ascension of Jesus in <a title="Acts 2 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=4#Pentecost" target="_blank">Acts 2 (see notes)</a>. Now, view that in the light of the baptism that New Testament Believers undergo after salvation by noticing <a title="Romans 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=17#Baptism" target="_blank">Romans 6:1-14 (see notes)</a>. When we are baptized by immersion as Believers, we are typifying death, burial and resurrection in Jesus Christ. That picture only became valid after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ on the cross. </font></p></td>

		<p><font size="3">These two cities mentioned by Jesus, Chorazin and Bethsaida, are right next to Capernaum on the north side of the Sea of Galilee in Northern Israel. Because of their rejection of the truth, Jesus passes judgment on those Jewish leaders there who reject his message. He compares them to two Old Testament cities; Tyre and Sidon were large Phoenician cities on the Mediterranean, not far away, and often denounced by Old Testament prophets for their Baal worship (<a title="Isaiah 23 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=23#Tyre" target="_blank">Isaiah 23, see notes</a>; <a title="Ezekiel 26 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=26#Tyre" target="_blank">Ezekiel 26:28, see notes</a>; <a title="Joel 3 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=8#Back" target="_blank">Joel 3:4, see notes</a>; <a title="Amos 1 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=13#Judgment" target="_blank">Amos 1:9-10, see notes</a>; <a title="Zechariah 9 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=20#More" target="_blank">Zechariah 9:2-4, see notes</a>). Of course, <b>Jesus knew their hearts</b> and the nature of their rejection despite all the miracles that had been done in that region. With all the miraculous events that Jesus had manifested before them, <b>the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida still remained attached to their old dead-end religion rather than to receive the Messiah's message of the new covenant</b> (<a title="Jeremiah 31 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=30#Covenant" target="_blank">Jeremiah 31:31-34, see notes</a>). Therefore, Jesus passed judgment upon them. As a matter of fact, that judgment message is extremely severe when he proclaims in verse 24, &quot;But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.&quot; Whoa! Sodom!

<p><font size="3">Jesus begins to pray, thanking God for the fact that everyday people (not the Jewish leaders) are receiving the Word. Pay close attention to verse 27, &quot;<b>...neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</b>&quot; In other words, <b>the only way to God today is through Jesus</b>. That's exactly what Jesus said in <a title="John 14 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=29#Way" target="_blank">John 14:6 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot; Then Jesus extends a familiar invitation in verses 28-30. To whom is the invitation extended? Look at verse 28, &quot;...all ye that labour and are heavy laden...&quot; We see here that Jesus is making a special appeal to those who are not the Jewish leaders. As we saw in the previous verses (20-24), those Jewish leaders had rejected Jesus. </font></p>

37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee&#146;s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, <br>
38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. <br>

40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. <br>
41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. <br>
42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? <br>
43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. <br>
44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. <br>
45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. <br>
46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. <br>
47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. <br>
48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. <br>

<p><b>This Pharisee's name is Simon. </b>He invites Jesus over for a meal. While at his house, a stranger, a woman from the city, shows up with a box of ointment. Verse 38 says, &quot; And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.&quot; To Simon the Pharisee, this is not only a strange sight, but a terribly inappropriate action as well, but not for the reasons that pop into our heads (it was a cultural thing). <b>He thinks that Jesus, if he's really a prophet, should know the sinful condition of this woman and that she has no business making any contact with a righteous prophet.</b> Simon gets a lesson in forgiveness, but not one to which a Pharisee is going to be very open. That lesson is that <b>both Simon and the woman are sinners, </b>but because the woman perceives her sin and the Pharisee ignores his own, she is, in fact, the one who is most grateful for forgiveness. Whoa! So how does this Pharisee take to the idea of being referred to as a sinner here? Well, because <b>Jesus uses a parable to make the point,</b> the Pharisee is not able to actually say that Jesus called him a sinner.</p>
<p><b>You will notice that Jesus forgives this woman's sins. What brought about this forgiveness, her actions? NO! Notice verse 50, &quot;Thy faith hath saved thee.&quot; It just so happens that her actions were a demonstration of her faith. Likewise, our actions should always be a demonstration of our faith.</b></p>
		<p>Incidentally, don't confuse this anointing/hair occasion with that of Mary, the sister of Lazarus (<a title="Matthew 26:6-13, Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=1#Supper" target="_blank">Matthew 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-11, see notes</a>). That takes place much later, just prior to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. <b>Another false identification that is common regarding this woman is that she was Mary Magdalene.</b> It is further conjectured that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. That misguided deduction is based upon the fact that she is mentioned in <a title="Mark 16 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=6&dy=26#Marys" target="_blank">Mark 16:9 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.&quot; A similar reference is found in <a title="Luke 8 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=18#People" target="_blank">Luke 8:2 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils.&quot; Being possessed with devils cannot be linked to prostitution in that verse. Although we are not told the symptoms of her demon possession, in all likelihood it was manifested with severe physical ailments and not a depraved lifestyle.</p>
		<p>So, who first proposed that this &quot;sinner&quot; woman was Mary Magdalene? Actually, it was the Roman Catholic Pope Gregory I who identified this Luke 7 woman as Mary Magdalene in a sermon back in 591 A.D. There is absolutely NO reason to believe that this woman was Mary Magdalene. We first see Mary in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=18#People" title="Luke 8 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 8:2 (see notes)</a>. There, she is a follower of Jesus along with other women. Let's face it: Pope Gregory blew the call. As a result, however, there are a host of Christians today who are convinced that this woman in Luke 7 was a prostitute, and that she is one in the same with Mary Magdalene.</p>
