<p><font size="3">It's more than just his twelve; Luke actually records the names of some women who were following at this point in time as well. And then add to that the &quot;great multitude.&quot; Notice the wording of Luke 8:2 here, &quot;And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils.&quot; One of these women is Mary Magdalene. It is commonly conjectured</font> that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. She was not. That misguided deduction is based upon the fact that she is mentioned here (&quot;<font size="3">out of whom went seven devils&quot;) and</font> in <a title="Mark 16 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=6&dy=26#Marys" target="_blank">Mark 16:9 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.&quot; Being possessed with devils cannot be linked to prostitution in that verse. Although we are not told the symptoms of her demon possession, in all likelihood it was manifested with severe physical ailments and not a depraved lifestyle. Actually, this reputation-marring accusation came first from Roman Catholic Pope Gregory I who improperly identified the &quot;sinner&quot; woman of <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=10#Pharisee" title="Luke 7 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 7:36-50 (see notes)</a> as Mary Magdalene in a sermon back in 591 A.D.</p>

<p>Here is an important truth about Jesus' ministry. <b>Why did he speak to the people in parables?</b> Some have suggested that Jesus' parables were given as crystal-clear illustrations to make a point. Well...not really! There is a concept here that needs to be understood first of all. We explained in the introduction of <a title="Matthew 5 Introduction" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=2#Top" target="_blank">Matthew 5 (see notes)</a> regarding the <b>Kingdom message that Jesus was preaching</b>. Jesus is once again presenting the Kingdom of God/Heaven to the Jews. This message has, as its central theme, Jesus as Messiah over an earthly kingdom. Since the<b> Jews rejected that at His first coming</b>, we understand that this kingdom will not materialize on earth until the second coming of Jesus. <b>Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would be rejected,</b> that he would suffer and be crucified. So, here <b>Jesus quotes from <a title="Isaiah 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=12#Isaiah" target="_blank">Isaiah 6:9-10</a></b><a title="Isaiah 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=12#Isaiah" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a>, &quot;And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.&quot;  Isaiah prophesied the rejection of the Messiah's message that would take place. Roll the clock forward 700 or so years from Isaiah, and here we are;<b> it's just as Isaiah prophesied.</b> Jesus is presenting the Kingdom message for them to receive, but the jealous Jewish leaders reject it - just like the Jewish leaders to whom Isaiah had prophesied. It was prophesied that they would do so. However, <b>those people with receptive hearts do understand the meaning of the parables; the Jewish leaders are not blessed by his words.</b> Furthermore, when Jesus spoke in parables these Jewish leaders were not able to gather clear statements that would meet their legal standard of blasphemy. Parables were very frustrating to these officials and professional religionists.<b> To state it clearly, parables were designed to keep the hypocritical Jewish leaders frustrated while spiritually feeding those who had receptive hearts.</b></p>

<p>Here's the meaning of that first parable in <font size="3">Matthew 13:3-9; Mark 4:3-9; Luke 8:4-8 (<a href="#Parable">see above</a>)</font>. Let's not make a common mistake that many people make when reading this passage.<b> Jesus is presenting the Kingdom message. Don't go any further without understanding this distinction, explained in the introduction of </b><a title="Matthew 5 Introduction" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=2#Top" target="_blank"><b>Matthew 5</b> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> If it's unclear, read the preceding section of this summary again. Secondly, pay very close attention to the wording of Matthew 13:19, &quot;When any one <b>heareth the word of the kingdom</b>...&quot; <b>You misrepresent this whole parable if you make the sown seed equivalent to a salvation experience.</b> <b>IT IS NOT!</b> It literally speaks of those who were exposed to Jesus' teaching on the coming Kingdom of God/Heaven on earth which had been prophesied by the Old Testament prophets. That understanding should make the rest of the parable fall into place. Only the last category of people (Matthew 13:23, Mark 4:20, Luke 8:15) actually receive this word of the Kingdom and respond to it. Remember, it's a kingdom message to the Jews. <b>Again, let me say, this parable has NO DIRECT RELEVANCE to the salvation experience of today.</b> While parallels certainly exist, keep in mind the strict application of this passage to the reception (or not) of the Kingdom message.</p>
<p><b>Let's take a look at the implications regarding the four kinds of ground upon which the seeds fell:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Some fell by the wayside and were immediately eaten by birds.<br>
				</b>They heard the message, perhaps found it interesting, but only had a passing interest and took no action by personalizing the message of the Kingdom.
			<li><b>Some fell on stony places and could not take root.<br>
				</b>These people heard the message and were interested, but they did not pursue the Kingdom message.
			<li><b>Some fell among thorns and was choked out.<br>
				</b>These people heard the message, were interested and began to pursue the Kingdom message. However, they allowed themselves to be influenced by those Jewish leaders who rejected the Messianic ministry of Jesus. This ultimately led to their rejection of the message as well.
			<li><b>The rest fell on good ground, grew and multiplied.<br>
				</b>These people heard, pursued, received and multiplied. These are the only ones of the four groups who followed through with discipleship after hearing the Messianic message.
        </ul>
		<p>Here's the BIG PROBLEM with equating this parable to salvation by grace as many under-studied people do. They often jump to the false conclusion that the sowing of this seed is the same as receiving Christ as Savior. After they make that interpretive error, they then assume that the first three scenarios represent a loss of salvation. THIS PARABLE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A BELIEVER'S SALVATION BY GRACE! Read the parable and notes above again if that is not clear to you.</p>

		<p>Only Mark and Luke give us this parable. This message is simple. If the crowds do not obey what light they receive, they will never receive more. These verses follow nicely behind the parable of the sower. This is a polite warning from Jesus to the multitudes to beware of dismissing this teaching without accepting the truth of the Kingdom message contained herein. They must take the light of the Kingdom message and pursue it as did those in the fourth group in the parable of the sower (<a href="#Sower">see above</a>).</p>

<p>Only Mark recites this parable. The seed, the Kingdom message, has been cast by Jesus. The analogy here is as follows: just as seed is cast onto the ground and the earth uses it to bear fruit for the harvest, so has Jesus cast the seed of the Kingdom message. The good ground (receptive heart) bears fruit worthy of harvest (entry into the Kingdom). This speaks of the Messianic Kingdom of Jesus on earth (<a title="Matthew 5 Introduction" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=2#Top" target="_blank">Matthew 5, see notes</a>) and not Heaven.</p>

<p> This mustard plant is only about four feet tall in the early spring when birds are nesting. Later on in the summer this plant (bush) may reach as high as 15 feet or so - plenty large for the nesting of birds. Likewise, <b>the Kingdom message will be preached in relative obscurity in the beginning </b>(small mustard seed)<b>, but will ultimately result in the world-wide ushering in of the Messiah's Kingdom of God/Heaven on earth.</b> I think this is perhaps <b>strictly a growth analogy</b> - from relative obscurity to a global kingdom - the Messianic Kingdom (<a title="Matthew 5 Introduction" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=2#Top" target="_blank">Matthew 5, see notes</a>) we know as the Millennium. </p>
<p>Some Bible teachers have read more into this parable than I feel comfortable doing with any certainty. They have suggested evil on the part of the birds that lodge in the mustard tree. Although, Jesus uses this metaphor again in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=7#Message" title="Luke 13 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 13:19 (see notes)</a>. On that occasion, Jesus had been addressing the insincerity and hypocrisy of the Jewish leadership. I can see how that one might understand the birds in the tree to be these hypocritical Jewish leaders, inasmuch as they are integrated into the growth environment, but not part of the growth. In other words, they are the problem and not the solution.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding the kingdom-aspect of these parables is crucial on this one </strong>(<a title="Matthew 5 Introduction" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=2#Top" target="_blank">Matthew 5, see notes</a>)<strong>.</strong> Here's the explanation by Jesus to his disciples of the parable he spoke in Matthew 13:24-30 (<a href="#Tares">see above</a>). As we said, wheat is good and tares are bad. <b>How do we go ahead and hack out the tares (wicked people)? Answer: We don't. Let both grow together until harvest.</b> Now here's the part we need to look at very closely - the harvest. Take a look at the players here in Matthew 13:38-39, &quot;The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.&quot; Notice that the harvest is at the end of the world and that the tares are the ones taken away and burned. <b>THIS IS NOT THE RAPTURE!</b> When the rapture takes place, the opposite will be realized: Righteous people will be taken out at the rapture, and wicked people will be left to endure the tribulation. The Greek word for &quot;world&quot; there is actually &quot;aionos,&quot; which is to be understood as &quot;age.&quot; <b>This wheat/tares parable is fulfilled at the end of the tribulation, immediately preceding the Messianic age we know to be the millennium.</b> That's when the righteous people continue on earth to populate the Kingdom (millennium) while the wicked people are burned up in <a title="Revelation 19 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=27#Armageddon" target="_blank">Revelation 19:11-21 (see notes)</a>.

<p><font size="3">In my opinion, many Bible teachers read way too much into this one as well.

I'm convinced that's the treasure. Those who receive this message sacrifice everything (become disciples) for the Kingdom message.

Now, while that preaches - makes a stirring sermon, I'm just not sure that it is that complicated. Nor do I think Jesus wandered out of his Kingdom context with these parables.</p>

<p>This parable seems similar to the parable of the wheat and tares (<a href="#Wheat">see above</a>). The net gathers all kinds of sea creatures, clean and unclean. They are separated out at the end; the good remain while the bad are cast away. The last three verses indicate the same immediate judgment scenario as the tares executed by the angels. <b>This can only be the judgment that follows the tribulation,</b> just as with the tares. Based upon that scenario, this cannot be the rapture.
