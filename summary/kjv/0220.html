				  <p><font size="3">The first vessel specified to be placed into the new house of God is to be the Ark of the Covenant. The Hebrew word here for &quot;ark&quot; is </font><font size="3">altogether different from the word used for Noah's big ol' boat. The Hebrew word for Noah's &quot;ark&quot; is &quot;tay-baw&acute;&quot; which is also used in Exodus 2:3,5 to describe the little basket that Moses was floating in when discovered by Pharaoh's daughter. <b>The Hebrew word used here for the &quot;Ark&quot; of the Covenant is &quot;aw-rone&acute;.&quot; It means &quot;box.&quot;</b> So while the words are identical to us in English, they were not to the Hebrews. You'll notice from verse 16 that<b> this box will contain the tablets</b> that will be given to Moses with the Law inscribed upon them. You'll also notice how elaborately made it is. This 2.25 ft. by 2.25 ft. by 3.75 ft. box is the<b> most sacred vessel in Israel's history.</b> Notice that there was a specific way in which it was to be carried - poles that slipped through rings on the side. That will become significant later on in Israel's history when they engineer their own design for transporting it in <a title="II Samuel 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=6&dy=15#Ark" target="_blank">II Samuel 6 (see notes)</a>, a flawed attempt that ends in death.<br>

				    <p><font size="2">1 And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits. <br>
			        2 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay it with brass. <br>
			        3 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. <br>
			        4 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof. <br>
			        5 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that the net may be even to the midst of the altar. <br>
			        6 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with brass. <br>
			        7 And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it. <br>
			        8 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee in the mount, so shall they make it. </font></p>
			      </blockquote>				  <p><font size="3">Here's the Brazen Altar. Notice how large it is: Exodus 27:1, &quot;And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits.&quot;<b> That's big - 7.5 feet square and 4.5 feet high.</b> Of course, it will be positioned outside in the courtyard. That's where the animal sacrifices will take place. <b>You'll see in verse 4 that Moses had his own &quot;network.&quot;</b></font> Actually, that's the grate that goes on the top of the altar. Oh, and you'll also notice that this will be carried by poles through rings as well.<br>
