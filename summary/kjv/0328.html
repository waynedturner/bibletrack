      <p><font size="2">1 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, <br>
      2 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers&rsquo; house, all that are able to go to war in Israel. <br>
      3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, <br>
      4 Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt. </font></p>

Reuben's immediate neighbors on the south side were Simeon and Gad. <b>Their numbers were reduced by 45,020 (approximately 30%) over those 38 years. Look at the huge hit in numbers Simeon alone took.</b> That rebellion gets mentioned in verses 9-11, but notice particularly verse 11, &quot;Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.&quot; So, the families of the Reubenites, Simeonites and Gadites were killed in that rebellion, but not Korah's children, who were Levites.<font size="2"><br>

      7 These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty. <br>
      8 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab. <br>

      11 Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Reuben's tribe took a hit in numbers between the first and second census. The reason is seen in verses 9-11; it was the rebellion that caused some massive deaths among the tribes on the south side of the tabernacle (<a title="Numbers 16 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=23#Democracy" target="_blank">Numbers 16, see notes</a>).

    <p><font size="3">Gad's tribe, located on the south side of the tabernacle along with Reuben and Simeon, also suffered a net loss in population between the first census and the second census.

      59 And the name of Amram&rsquo;s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister. <br>

    <p>The Levites were numbered from one month old upward - only males. <b>Their number in the 40th year according to verse 62 was 23,000.</b> They weren't numbered above because they were separated out and received no inheritance of land for their tribe. The Levites lived among the other twelve tribes upon arrival into Canaan.</p>
    <p>You will recall that when the Hebrews wanted to stone Moses and Aaron after the spies came back in <a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=21#People" target="_blank">Numbers 14 (see notes)</a>, God made a decree which kept them in the wilderness for another 38+ years. Remember his words in <b>Numbers 14:29-30, &quot;Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me, Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save <font color="#ee0000">Caleb</font> the son of Jephunneh, and <font color="#ee0000">Joshua</font> the son of Nun.&quot;</b></p>
		<p>Now notice the comment made regarding this fortieth-year census in <b>Numbers 26:64-65, &quot;But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save <font color="#ee0000">Caleb</font> the son of Jephunneh, and <font color="#ee0000">Joshua</font> the son of Nun.&quot;</b></p>
		<p>Here's an interesting aspect of this count. Who is now the High Priest succeeding Aaron and going on into Canaan with Israel? If you said <font color="#ee0000"><b>Eleazar</b></font>, you are correct. However, <b>Eleazar was serving as a priest under his father Aaron back before the spies were sent out</b>, so obviously he was an adult at that point in time, and if we follow the service age of the priests in <a title="Numbers 4 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=15#Levites" target="_blank">Numbers 4 (see notes)</a>, <b>he was at least 30 years old</b>. Yet, he did not die before reaching Canaan. <b>Therefore, one can confidently deduct that the Levites were exempt from the judgment on the adult men of </b><a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=21#People" target="_blank"><b>Numbers 14:29-30 (see notes)</b></a><b>. <i>Refer to the window to the right of this screen for a full development of the wilderness decree <a title="The Wilderness Decree" href="http://www.bibletrack.com/notes/resource/misc/Wilderness_death_decree.html" target="_blank">or click here to read it in a separate window.</a></i></b></p>

	      2 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, <br>
	      3 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons. <br>
	      4 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father. <br>
	      5 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD. <br>
	      6 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
	      7 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father&rsquo;s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. <br>
	      8 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. <br>
	      9 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. <br>
	      10 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father&rsquo;s brethren. <br>
	      11 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
		<p><font size="3">The squeaky wheel gets the oil. These women (daughters of Zelophehad of the Tribe of Manasseh) approach Moses with their problem. Because their father had died in the wilderness since they left Egypt, current inheritance laws leave them with nothing when they arrive in Canaan. Hmmm...big Law revision is in view here; Moses consults God himself on the issue. Subsequently, God commands Moses to make some you-won't-be-left-out legislation to take care of the situation for them as well as others who may fall into that category. </font></p>

		<p>That's right; Joshua gets the big job. Moses had gotten the word from God that, because of his fit of rage in <a title="Numbers 20 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=24#Years" target="_blank">Numbers 20:1&#150;13 (see notes)</a> regarding the water-from-the-rock incident, he won't be going on over into Canaan with his people. However, we do see the concept of eternal life in verse 13 when God tells Moses, &quot;thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people.&quot; They hold a swearing-in ceremony before the people for Joshua where Eleazar (the High Priest) &quot;gives him a charge in their sight.&quot; <b>Meet your new leader: Joshua!</b></p>
		<p>Incidentally, Joshua had all the right credentials for the job. As a matter of fact, Joshua ascended the mountain with Moses in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=19#Mountain" title="Exodus 24 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 24:13 (see notes)</a> when God gave the plan for the tabernacle to Moses. Joshua was with Moses when they descended from the mountain in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=23#God" title="Exodus 32 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 32:17 (see notes)</a> to find that Aaron had constructed a golden calf. Since there are only two non-Levite men who were with Moses out of Egypt (Joshua and Caleb), it just makes sense that Joshua is God's man to lead Israel.</p>
