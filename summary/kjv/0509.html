2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, <br>
3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. <br>
4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. <br>
5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: <br>
6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. <br>
7 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. <br>
8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. <br>
9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. <br>
10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. <br>
11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: <br>
12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. <br>
13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <br>

<p><font size="3">This string of parables (this being the third in the series) began back in <a title="Matthew 21 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=5#Jesus" target="_blank">Matthew 21:23 (see notes)</a> when <b>Jesus was asked by the chief priests and elders, &quot;By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?&quot;</b> The first two parables in reply (Matthew 21:28-32 and 21:33-46) are designed to point out that these so-called leaders would not be comprising the coming Kingdom of God (on earth) because of their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. This third parable makes the same point. <b>The wedding setting (wedding celebrations sometimes lasted as long as a week) is a picture of the Kingdom of God (on earth) that Jesus has been proclaiming in fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah.</b></font></p>
<p><b>It is obvious here that those who were initially invited to the wedding are analogous to these Jewish leaders.</b> Just like the original guests decline to attend the wedding, these leaders who questioned Jesus' authority are declining to be a part of any Kingdom in which Jesus is the head. Interestingly, this parable offers them a second chance to reconsider; they again decline. Not only so, but they treat the messengers with contempt. Yup! <b>We're still drawing an analogy to these wicked Jewish leaders of Jesus' day. </b>Who ends up coming to the wedding? It's just plain common folks who attend. <b>Likewise, Jesus reaches beyond the Jewish leadership of his day and extends an invitation for the common people to receive the message of the Kingdom of God (on earth).</b> You will notice also that those who declined the invitation are destroyed in verse 7.</p>
		<p>This parable has a little twist. One man manages to get into the wedding who does not belong. At the end of the tribulation, the Kingdom of God (on earth) will begin with only those who have come out of the tribulation with a believing relationship in Jesus Christ. <b>No impostors will be allowed. </b>The earth will begin the millennium (wedding feast) with only invited guests (those who trusted God by faith during the tribulation). Likewise, the party crasher is not permitted to participate because he was not an invited guest. Incidentally, here we see an oft-misused verse 14, &quot;For many are called, but few are chosen.&quot; As you can see, the actual context of this verse indicates that, while many are invited to participate in the Kingdom of God on earth (we know it now as the millennium), only those chosen to be there and who have complied with the Messiah's criteria will be permitted to be a part of that Kingdom.</p>
	<p><strong>The wedding-supper scenario is used by Jesus to describe the millennium in <a title="Matthew 25 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=21#Supper" target="_blank">Matthew 25:1-13</a></strong><a title="Matthew 25 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=21#Supper" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a> as well. In that analogy we once again see those who do not belong there in an expanded scenario. The party crashers (so to speak) are then described in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=21#Tribulation" title="Matthew 25 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 25:31-46 (see notes)</a>, but there we find out more about their identity. They are Gentiles who rejected the Gospel message spread by the witnesses during the tribulation leading up to the millennium. Rather than being granted access to the millennium (the wedding feast), they are banished when it is said in Matthew 25:41, &quot;Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.&quot; Then we see in Matthew 25:46, &quot;And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.&quot;</p>

				<td valign="top" width="40%"><font size="4"><b> Pharisees:</b></font><font size="2"> separatists (Heb. persahin, from parash, &#147;to separate&#148;). They were probably the successors of the Assideans (i.e., the &#147;pious&#148;), a party that originated in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes in revolt against his heathenizing policy. The first mention of them is in a description by Josephus of the three sects or schools into which the Jews were divided (B.C. 145). The other two sects were the Essenes and the Sadducees. In the time of our Lord they were the popular party (John 7:48). They were extremely accurate and minute in all matters appertaining to the law of Moses (Matt. 9:14; 23:15; Luke 11:39; 18:12). Paul, when brought before the council of Jerusalem, professed himself a Pharisee (Acts 23:6-8; 26:4, 5).<br>
						<br>
						
					
				There was much that was sound in their creed, yet their system of religion was a form and nothing more. Theirs was a very lax morality (Matt. 5:20; 15:4, 8; 23:3, 14, 23, 25; John 8:7). On the first notice of them in the New Testament (Matt. 3:7), they are ranked by our Lord with the Sadducees as a &#147;generation of vipers.&#148; They were noted for their self-righteousness and their pride (Matt. 9:11; Luke 7:39; 18:11, 12). They were frequently rebuked by our Lord (Matt. 12:39; 16:1-4).<br>
						<br>
						
					
				From the very beginning of his ministry the Pharisees showed themselves bitter and persistent enemies of our Lord. They could not bear his doctrines, and they sought by every means to destroy his influence among the people.</font></td>
				<td valign="top" width="35%"><font size="4"><b>Sadducees:</b></font><font size="2"> The origin of this Jewish sect cannot definitely be traced. It was probably the outcome of the influence of Grecian customs and philosophy during the period of Greek domination. The first time they are met with is in connection with John the Baptist&#146;s ministry. They came out to him when on the banks of the Jordan, and he said to them, &#147;O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?&#148; (Matt. 3:7.) The next time they are spoken of they are represented as coming to our Lord tempting him. He calls them &#147;hypocrites&#148; and &#147;a wicked and adulterous generation&#148; (Matt. 16:1-4; 22:23). The only reference to them in the Gospels of Mark (Mark 12:18-27) and Luke (Luke 20:27-38) is their attempting to ridicule the doctrine of the resurrection, which they denied, as they also denied the existence of angels. They are never mentioned in John&#146;s Gospel.<br>
						<br>
						
					
				There were many Sadducees among the &#147;elders&#148; of the Sanhedrin. They seem, indeed, to have been as numerous as the Pharisees (Acts 23:6). They showed their hatred of Jesus in taking part in his condemnation (Matt. 16:21; 26:1-3, 59; Mark 8:31; 15:1; Luke 9:22; 22:66). They endeavoured to prohibit the apostles from preaching the resurrection of Christ (Acts 2:24, 31, 32; 4:1, 2; 5:17, 24-28). They were the deists or sceptics of that age. They do not appear as a separate sect after the destruction of Jerusalem.</font></td>

Luke is quite clear regarding their intentions on this occasion in Luke 20:20 when he reports, &quot;And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.&quot; The phrase &quot;feign themselves just men&quot; means that they portrayed themselves as righteous.&quot; Righteous?

It's interesting, though, that <b>they controlled the priesthood</b>; the High Priest was always chosen from among the Sadducees during this period. I'm confident they used this hypothetical illustration of theirs quite often to show what they considered the fallacy of the resurrection doctrine. They base their illustration upon the provision for widows who had not yet born children in <a title="Deuteronomy 25 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=14#Wife" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 25:5-6 (see notes)</a>. These marriages are referred to in Hebrew culture as &quot;levirate&quot; marriages. This woman (their hypothetical woman) survives seven (count 'em, 7) husbands. Although they claim in Matthew 22:25 that the story is true, I'm just not buying it.<b> To me, the bigger question should have been, &quot;How bad can one woman's cooking be?&quot;</b> In my opinion, only the Son of God could hold a straight face while they go through this ridiculous scenario. Nonetheless, in their minds, Jesus must reject the doctrine of the resurrection which will once and for all put him at odds with the Pharisees. Instead, <b>Jesus tells all of them something they did not know about Heaven - people don't marry there.</b> It's easy to overlook, but notice in Luke's account in Luke 2</font><font size="3" color="black">0:39, &quot;</font><font color="black">Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.&quot; These were the professional copyists and students of the Law, and they were impressed.</font></p>
<p><font color="black">Jesus makes another point here which strikes at the heart of the Sadducees' belief system when he quotes God speaking to Moses in <a title="Exodus 3 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=9#Bush" target="_blank">Exodus 3:6 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Moreover he said, <b>I am the God</b> of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&quot; Since the Sadducees only respected the Law of Moses and rejected the resurrection, the &quot;I am the God&quot; (present tense) accentuated an inconsistency in their doctrine of no resurrection. In other words, God tells Moses that he IS the God of those who had already passed from mortal life to eternal life i.e. resurrected.</font></p>

		<p>Not wanting to be outdone in this duel with Jesus, <b>the Pharisees appoint one of their own scribes (and a lawyer) to ask Jesus a question,</b> &quot;Which is the great commandment in the law?&quot; That seems like a pretty lame attempt to stump Jesus; every observant Jew (then and now) quotes several times a day <a title="Deuteronomy 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=6#Shema" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 6:4-6 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

	<p>That's right. If you want to summarize the Law of Moses, here it is boiled down to just two action items: (1) Love for God and (2) Love for one another. Mark 12:32-34 are interesting here. It appears that the scribe who asked the question is impressed, and Jesus recognizes his softened attitude toward the Kingdom message when he says to him in verse 34, &quot;Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.&quot; </p>
