				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">To the chief Musician, A Psalm and Song of David. <br>
    1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed. <br>
    2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. <br>
    3 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away. <br>
    4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. <br>
    5 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea: <br>
    6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power: <br>
    7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. <br>
    8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. <br>
    9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it. <br>
    10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof. <br>
    11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness. <br>
    12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side. <br>
    13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a Psalm that recounts the blessings of God. David writes this one, and he makes particular reference to the blessings of God on Zion (Jerusalem). Getting a fix on the exact period of this writing is difficult. David's reference to the &quot;temple&quot; in verse 4 would indicate that, at the very least, David was anticipating the building of the temple in Jerusalem at the time of this writing. David lists the great blessings  and works of God.</p>
<p>Verse 3 is particularly noteworthy: &quot;Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.&quot; David acknowledges the remedy for sin - then and now; it is purged away by God himself. For us, that's <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=3#Purpose" title="I John 1 Summary" target="_blank">I John 1:9 (see notes)</a>, &quot;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">To the chief Musician, A Song or Psalm. <br>
    1 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands: <br>
    2 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious. <br>
    3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee. <br>
    4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah. <br>
    5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men. <br>
    6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him. <br>
    7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah. <br>
    8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard: <br>
    9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved. <br>
    10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. <br>
    11 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins. <br>
    12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place. <br>
    13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows, <br>
    14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. <br>
    15 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah. <br>
    16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul. <br>
    17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue. <br>
    18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me: <br>
    19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer. <br>
    20 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This unknown author expresses that, while God has allowed him to go through trial, he answers his prayers for deliverance and blessing. Look at verse 18, &quot;If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:&quot; The author understood that harbored sin interfered with his fellowship with God.</p>
<p><b>A brief overview of this Psalm is:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>A call on all the earth to praise God (verses 1-12)
			<li>The author offers sacrifice and praise (verses 13-15)
			<li>The author exhorts the people to prayer and praise (verses 16-20). 
        </ul>
        <p>Incidentally, the multiple occurrences of the transliterated Hebrew word &quot;Selah&quot; here  are unusual. While the word of unknown meaning is used 72 times in Psalms and two times in Habakkuk, it is usually found once at the end of a Psalm. Here it is used three times. Perhaps the word meant &quot;rest,&quot; having something to do with the presentation of the song itself.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>God be merciful unto us, and bless us (Psalm 67)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm or Song. <br>
    1 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah. <br>
    2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. <br>
    3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. <br>
    4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. <br>
    5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. <br>
    6 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. <br>
    7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">We aren't given the authorship of this Psalm, but it seems to fit into the same group as Psalm 66. The multiple occurrences of the transliterated Hebrew word &quot;Selah&quot; here  are unusual, used twice here and three times in Psalm 66 (<a href="#Awesome">see above</a>). With regard to the subtitle, The &#147;chief musician on Neginoth&#148; is the leader of that part of the temple choir which played on stringed instruments. </font>Let the people praise God. I can picture the people singing this one in the fields as they harvest their crops.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, A Psalm of David. <br>
    1 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. <br>
    2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. <br>
    3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. <br>
    4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away. <br>
    5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee. <br>
    6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. <br>
    7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. <br>
    8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother&rsquo;s children. <br>
    9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. <br>
    10 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. <br>
    11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them. <br>
    12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards. <br>
    13 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. <br>
    14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. <br>
    15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. <br>
    16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. <br>
    17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily. <br>
    18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies. <br>
    19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee. <br>
    20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. <br>
    21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. <br>
    22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. <br>
    23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake. <br>
    24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. <br>
    25 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents. <br>
    26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. <br>
    27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. <br>
    28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. <br>
    29 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. <br>
    30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. <br>
    31 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs. <br>
    32 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God. <br>
    33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners. <br>
    34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. <br>
    35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession. <br>
    36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">David is identified as the author here in the introduction. The introduction also contains the words, &quot;To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim.&quot; That's the name of some musical instrument - probably one shaped like a lily. It's also found in the introduction to Psalm 45.</font></p>
<p><b>Note what is written regarding this Psalm in the Expositor's Bible Commentary: </b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Because of the many references to it in the NT, this psalm has been interpreted messianically. The messianic interpretation is in the form of an application to the life of devotion to God by the Lord Jesus Christ. The primary significance is David and his suffering. He calls on the Lord to deliver him (vv.1-21) for the sake of &#147;those who hope in you&#148; (v.6). Moreover, he prays for the fall of the wicked (vv.22-29). The lament changes to a hymn of thanksgiving in anticipation of God&#146;s redemption (vv.29-36).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><b>So, what about it? Is this Psalm messianic prophecy or not? Let's look at some of the wording in Psalms 69 and see how it was quoted in the New Testament.</b></p>

		<p>T<b>here's no question that Psalm 69:4 and 9 were definitely held by John, Paul and the rest of the disciples to be references to the Messiah.</b></p>
	<p>While not specifically mentioned in <a title="Matthew 27:48, Mark 15:36, John 19:29-30 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=-1&mo=6&dy=23#Darkness" target="_blank">Matthew 27:48, Mark 15:36, John 19:29-30 (see notes)</a> the vinegar given to Jesus seconds before his death on the cross seems to fit nicely with the prophetic words of Psalm 69:21, &quot;They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.&quot;</p>
	<p>Interestingly enough, Peter makes use of verse 25 when he quotes it as justification for replacing Judas in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=4" title="Acts 1 Summary" target="_blank">Acts 1:20 (see notes)</a>. It is obvious, therefore, that Peter held Judas wholly culpable for the deeds he had done by the Jewish leaders and Romans at the crucifixion. Peter's interest there seems to be to eradicate any influence Judas had in the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ.</p>
