	<p><font size="3">John the Baptist was born six months before Jesus. In this passage we see the purpose of John the Baptist's ministry manifested as the forerunner of Jesus, the Messiah. Although Mark 1:2 is taken from <a href="10-5.html#Fulfillment" target="_blank">Isaiah 40 (see notes)</a>. Isaiah 40:3 is quoted here in reference to the Messiah. When John the Baptist quotes Isaiah (Matthew 3:3, Mark 1:3, Luke 3:4), it is clear to his listeners that he is introducing Jesus as the Messiah. Also notice the call John makes according to Matthew 3:2 when he says, &quot;Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&quot; You cannot understand the Gospels without understanding specifically what the &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot; really is. Remember this definition: <b>The &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot; is the literal establishment of the Messiah ruling over all the earth.</b> It is not a vague reference to Believers going to Heaven when they die. It is literally the Messianic promise of the Old Testament prophets being fulfilled.</font> Luke continues his account in verses 5-6 by citing two additional verses from Isaiah 40:4-5 that John quoted that day.	    </p>

<p><font size="3"><b>The religious system under the Sadducees and Pharisees was a mess.</b> Their standards of righteousness were superficial, and their religious system was not open to change. Then, here comes John the Baptist - nothing conventional about him whatsoever (dressed weird; unusual diet)...and he's calling upon them to repent (literally: turn to God). <b>What! They thought they had a corner on God!</b> This could be trouble. John makes it worse when he calls the Sadducees and Pharisees a &quot;generation of vipers&quot; (Matthew 3:7, Luke 3:7). He adds, &quot;And don't tout your ancestry back to Abraham; you need to repent!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>What was this baptism all about?</b> It was a custom among the Jews to require proselytes to Judaism to be baptized. <b>John's baptism is not a picture of today's Believers' baptism. </b></font>I have heard preachers refer to John's requirement that they bring forth fruit (actions) meet (worthy) of repentance prior to their baptism as being the same standard for new Believers today. These preachers require a waiting period before they will baptize new converts to make certain they live the appropriate lifestyle first. They base this requirement on John's words in this passage. <b>Peter required no such thing on the Day of Pentecost in </b><a title="Acts 2 Summary" href="7-4.html#Explain" target="_blank"><b>Acts 2:38-41</b> (see notes)</a><b>!</b> To make such a requirement is to take scripture out of its context. John had already addressed their wickedness and was now calling upon them to turn from that wickedness and be baptized. Their pride of heritage in being the children of Abraham was no substitute for an individual, authentic relationship with God.</p>

		<p><font size="3">John knew their corrupt condition. A relationship with God ought to foster positive attitudes toward others. Luke 3:10-15 gives us a record of the specifics to their question, &quot;What shall we do then? These suggestions were by no means meant to be a comprehensive plan for salvation for these people, but merely a declaration to expose their wrong attitudes toward God and to demonstrate what will follow when a person authentically seeks to please God with his life.

<p><font size="3">John the Baptist makes a differentiation. He's baptizing in water those who repent. However, he's introducing Christ (&quot;Christ&quot; is the English transliteration for the Greek word for &quot;Messiah&quot;) who will do a supernatural baptism - a baptism by the Holy Spirit (Ghost and Spirit come from the exact same Greek word, &quot;pneuma&quot;). John also mentions &quot;fire&quot; and a &quot;fan.&quot; It's an agricultural analogy. The fan (winnowing fork) was used to sift the chaff from the wheat, and then the chaff was burned in the fire while the wheat was preserved. Get the picture? <b>The Messiah, through the power of the Holy Spirit, will accurately separate Believers from the wicked.</b> And the wicked...that's kinda self explanatory - don't you think? Hey John! This kind of preaching can land you in prison! And, we see in Luke 3:18-20 that it did.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I guess everybody understands that, when a preacher ruffles the feathers of the influential, bad things come with the good. This time it's a woman (Herodias) who's not a fan of the message John the Baptist is preaching. Here's why. Herodias had been married to a guy named Philip who was the half brother of Herod the tetrarch. Herodias left Philip for Herod. <b>Philip and Herod were sons of Herod the great</b>, the man who had attempted to orchestrate the death of the Messiah by having all the babies murdered after the birth of Jesus. John's preaching here is very convicting to Herod and Herodias because of their disdain for the marriage vows, so John the Baptist is imprisoned. After only a few months of preaching that introduced Jesus as the Messiah, the preaching ministry of John the Baptist came to a close. <b>John remained in prison until he was beheaded in </b><a title="Matthew 14 Summary" href="3-6.html#Background" target="_blank"><b>Matthew 14:3-12 </b>(see notes)</a>.</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">Why would Jesus feel the need to be baptized? When John brings up that point, Christ replies, &quot;...for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.&quot; It's important to understand this baptism of Jesus. <b>Was he being baptized &quot;...with water unto repentance...&quot; as John the Baptist was pleading for people to do? NOPE! </b>He was sinless, perfect - had nothing to confess or repent from. Well then, WHY? Here's what I think is meant by Jesus' baptism being executed &quot;to fulfil all righteousness.&quot; Old Testament priests were washed with water and anointed with oil as part of the sanctification process for the priesthood under Aaron, according to<a title="March 3 Summary" href="8-17.html#Baptism" target="_blank">Romans 6, see notes</a>). This baptism by John marked the beginning of Christ's earthly ministry as our great high priest.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Incidentally, note the words of God saying, &quot;</font>Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.&quot; This undoubtedly reminded those who heard the voice of Psalm 2:7, &quot;I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.&quot; <a title="Psalm 2 Summary" href="6-16.html#Messianic" target="_blank">Psalm 2 (see notes)</a> was recognized as a Messianic Psalm.</p>

<p><font size="3">Well, the Pharisees (verse 24) sent some priests and Levites (verse 19) out to interrogate this wild-looking man (John the Baptist) who was preaching and baptizing. We are told in verse 28 that this incident takes place on the Jordan River at Bethabara, about 18 miles east of Jerusalem.</font></p>
<p><b>Now take a comparative look at two verses:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>John 1:23 He said, I am <b>the voice of one crying in the wilderness</b>, Make straight the way of the Lord, <b>as said the prophet Esaias.</b><br>
				<font size="3"><a title="Isaiah 40 Summary" href="10-5.html#Fulfillment" target="_blank">Isaiah 40:3 (see notes)</a></font> <b>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness,</b> Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As you can plainly see, <b>John professes to be the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy</b>, a prophecy also made in <a title="Malachi 3 Summary" href="12-30.html#Elijah" target="_blank">Malachi 4:5-6 (see notes)</a> concerning the coming of the Messiah. <font size="3">Now here's the confusion. <b>These priests and Levites are familiar with Malachi's prophecies</b>. It appears from this passage that the Pharisees differentiated between Elijah of Malachi 4:5-6 and the Messenger of Malachi 3:1 as seen in verses 21 and 25. So, they reason, if John the Baptist is introducing the Messiah, and the Messiah is here to judge the nations and establish the throne of David, then <b>John the Baptist must be Elijah according to Malachi.</b> <b>But John says he's not Elijah in verse 21!</b> Well, was he or wasn't he? <b>The answer is: he could have been.</b> You see, Malachi's prophecy looked all the way into the millennium. <b>When John the Baptist and Jesus came, the Jews did have an opportunity to receive him as their Messiah and usher in the rule of Israel over the earth under the Davidic throne.</b> However, it had been prophesied that they would reject, and Christ knew that in advance as well (of course he did). Therefore, John the Baptist would have fulfilled the Malachi prophecy had the Jews readily accepted the Messiah, but they did not...so John was not Elijah.

<p><font size="3">From the wording of verse 29, it would appear that the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist had already occurred on a previous day. Now it's time for John the Baptist's personal testimony regarding Jesus himself in verses 30-34.

	<p><b>Let's take a look at the words of Moses in </b><a title="Deuteronomy 18 Summary" href="4-12.html#Prophet" target="_blank"><b>Deuteronomy 18:15-19</b> (see notes)</a><b>:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Deuteronomy 18:15 The LORD thy <b>God will raise up unto thee a Prophet</b> from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; <br>
				Deuteronomy 18:16 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not. <br>
				Deuteronomy 18:17 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken. <br>
        Deuteronomy 18:18 <b>I will raise them up a Prophet </b>from among their brethren, like unto thee, and <b>will put my words in his mouth</b>; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. <br>
				Deuteronomy 18:19 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I find this passage particularly interesting in two respects. First of all, I feel relatively certain that the Israelites to whom this prophecy was first given must have thought Moses was talking about Joshua who succeeded him after his retirement (so to speak). That description certainly fits him. However, Philip believes what apparently many (if not virtually all) Jews in his day believe, that Deuteronomy 18:15-19 is a direct reference to the Messiah. To make this discussion more interesting, consider this: &quot;Jesus&quot; is a Greek transliteration for the Hebrew name &quot;Joshua.&quot; So, just as Joshua led Israel into Canaan, so will Jesus (Joshua) lead Israel into the millennium. We do find that Jesus, after his resurrection, confirms that Deuteronomy 18:15-19 is a reference to himself in <a title="Luke 24 Summary" href="6-26.html#Two" target="_blank">Luke 24:27 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.&quot; For a more comprehensive look at this issue, consult the information box to the right of this window or <a title="Moses prophesied the Messiah article" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Moses-Messiah.html" target="_blank">click here to read the article entitled, &quot;Moses prophesied the Messiah.&quot;</a></p>
		<p>Verse 46 is amusing as well when Nathan questions Philip regarding Jesus, &quot;Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?&quot; Hey! What do you have against Nazareth? Well, probably being unaware of Jesus' Bethlehem roots at the time, it was a fair question. I mean...a Messiah from Nazareth? Jesus' very first words to Nathanael are an interesting play on words when he says of him, &quot;Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!&quot; Jesus is undoubtedly making a reference to  Isaac's words concerning Jacob in <a href="1-28.html#Blessing" title="Genesis 27 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 27:35 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.&quot; The word &quot;subtilty&quot; there is the equivalent of &quot;guile.&quot; When Nathanael wonders how Jesus was able to make such a correlation, having just met him, Jesus reveals to Nathanael in verse 48 that he had a vision of Nathanael under a fig tree. As we see in verse 49, that settles it for Nathanael.</p>

		<p><font size="3">Of course Satan is determined to discover the credentials of Jesus as well. After all, Satan is not omniscient. <a title="Isaiah 9 Summary" href="9-16.html#Messiah" target="_blank">Isaiah 9:6-7 (see notes)</a> clearly characterized the nature of the Messiah: </font></p>
<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="3">For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, <b>The mighty God, The everlasting Father</b>, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.</font></p>
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
		<p><font size="3">So, I'm guessing this episode is <b>Satan's attempt to see exactly what he's dealing with here:</b> Is Jesus God in the flesh or not. <b>If Jesus will succumb to temptation and sin</b> (abandon his Messianic mission)<b>, then he is not the promised Messiah</b>. You must keep in mind that <b>Satan is not omniscient (nor omnipotent nor omnipresent)</b>. However, he does know the scripture and has talked with God...<b>but he's not omniscient. Contrary to popular belief, he can't even read your thoughts</b>. So Satan is using the conventional method of Messiah testing in this passage of scripture. <b>RESULTS: Jesus is 100% Messiah, God in the flesh...and he won't perform any parlor tricks to obtain a big prize from Satan.</b></font></p>
		<p>These temptations placed before Jesus follow forty days of fasting. It is worth noting that these forty days match those of Moses when he ascended to Mount Sinai in <a href="4-8.html#Good" title="Deuteronomy 9 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 9:9 (see notes)</a> that Moses also fasted for these forty days and forty nights.</p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Despite being God in the flesh, Jesus quotes scripture as he combats the temptations of Satan:</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="3">Matthew 4:3-4 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, <b>It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</b><br>
						<i>Quoted from <a title="Deuteronomy 8 Summary" href="4-8.html#Moses" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 8:3 (see notes)</a><br>
						</i><br>
						Matthew 4:5-7 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, <b>It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.<br>
						</b><i>Quoted from <a title="Deuteronomy 6 Summary" href="4-6.html#Shema" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 6:16 (see notes)</a><br>
						</i><b><br>
						</b>Matthew 4:8-10 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: <b>for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.<br>

		<p><font size="3">It is interesting to note, however, that Satan himself quotes scripture in this verbal duel when he says in verse 6, &quot;for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.&quot; That's a quotation from <a title="Psalm 91 Summary" href="4-18.html#Go" target="_blank">Psalm 91:11-12 (see notes)</a>; it just goes to show you, quoting scripture out of context is something that even Satan does.</font></p>
