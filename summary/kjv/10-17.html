    <td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#cce1ff"><font size="2">1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath. <br>
      2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. <br>
      3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying, <br>
      4 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people: <br>
      5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house, <br>
      6 Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house. <br>
      7 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully. <br>
      8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it. <br>
      9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD. <br>
      10 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king. <br>
      11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes. <br>
      12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king&rsquo;s, saying, <br>
      13 Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us. <br>
      14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her. <br>
      15 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me, <br>
      16 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read: <br>
      17 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched. <br>
      18 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard; <br>
      19 Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD. <br>
    20 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again. </font></td>
    <td align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#cce1ff" width="60%"><font size="2">1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years. <br>
      2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left. <br>
      3 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images. <br>
      4 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them. <br>
      5 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. <br>
      6 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about. <br>
      7 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem. <br>
      8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God. <br>
      9 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem. <br>
      10 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house: <br>
      11 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. <br>
      12 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick. <br>
      13 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters. <br>
      14 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses. <br>
      15 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan. <br>
      16 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it. <br>
      17 And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen. <br>
      18 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king. <br>
      19 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes. <br>
      20 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king&rsquo;s, saying, <br>
      21 Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book. <br>
      22 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect. <br>
      23 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me, <br>
      24 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah: <br>
      25 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched. <br>
      26 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard; <br>
      27 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD. <br>
      28 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again. <br>

<p>After the untimely death of the wicked Amon in <a title="II Chronicles 33 Summary" href="10-14.html#Amon" target="_blank">II Chronicles 33:21-25 (see notes)</a>, Judah gets his son, Josiah, as their new <b>8-year-old king.</b> What does an 8-year-old know about ruling? That's not a normal childhood! We aren't told in either passage who gave counsel to Josiah in his early years, but we are told that <b>he began to seek the One True God when he was 16 and by age 20 decided it was the right time to make his move.</b> He just didn't want any part of his father's evilness (good boy!). He immediately sets out to clean up Israel (yes, the Northern Kingdom too according to II Chronicles 34:6 and II Kings 23:15) - gets rid of the high places and pagan altars; but first, he executed and burned the bones of those idolatrous priests on their own pagan altars. I'm guessing they didn't see that coming! <b>At about 26 years of age, he commissions the repair of the temple</b> which had been severely abused under the reigns of his wicked father, Amon, and his equally wicked grandfather, Manasseh. Apparently, due to the weakened condition of the Assyrian Empire at this time, Josiah was able to purge all of Israel (Northern and Southern Kingdoms) of its idols and pagan altars.</p>
<p>In the process of this &quot;spring cleaning&quot; (so to speak), <b>the high priest, Hilkiah, finds the Book of the Law.</b> Obviously nobody had cared about it since King Hezekiah many decades earlier, so it apparently had been misplaced - perhaps deliberately. <b>After hearing the reading of the law, Josiah realizes how corrupt they had become under his Pa and Grandpa.</b> He sends out for a prophecy - not to the now-famous Jeremiah, but to Huldah, the unpublished prophetess. Huldah lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter of the city (rendered &quot;college&quot; in the KJV). She delivers a harsh prophecy though - says <b>Jerusalem will be punished for their actions, but not in Josiah's lifetime because of his faithfulness to God.</b> Although Josiah had been a good king, Judah had already stepped way over the line. </p>
		<p>Let's do a little refresher concerning the statement of II Chronicles 34:24, &quot;Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, <b>even all the curses that are written in the book</b> which they have read before the king of Judah.&quot; These are the curses recorded in Deuteronomy where it was prophesied that Israel would fall because of idolatry some 800 or so years earlier. As a matter of fact, after entering Canaan, they had a big blessing/cursing ceremony on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal (simultaneously) shouting the promised blessings and cursings. The actual event is recorded in <a href="3-12.html#Blessing" target="_blank">Leviticus 26 (see notes)</a>. After all Israel/Judah had been through, imagine how Josiah and company must have felt after seeing that all of these unfortunate events in Israel's history had been prophesied some 800 years earlier.</p>

      2 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. <br>
      3 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant. <br>
      4 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel. <br>
      5 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven. <br>
      6 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. <br>
      7 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove. <br>
      8 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man&rsquo;s left hand at the gate of the city. <br>
      9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren. <br>
      10 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. <br>
      11 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire. <br>
      12 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron. <br>
      13 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile. <br>
      14 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men. <br>
      15 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove. <br>
      16 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words. <br>
      17 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel. <br>
      18 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. <br>
      19 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel. <br>
      20 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men&rsquo;s bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem. <br>

<p>Despite the prophecy against Judah from the prophetess, <b>Josiah determines to clean up Judah AND Israel - I mean really clean up!</b> He calls the people of Judah/Israel together and has the law read to them. He pledges to follow the law himself and II Kings 23:3 says, &quot;...And all the people stood to the covenant.&quot; <b>He gets rid of all the pagan altars and tears down the cultish male prostitution house.</b> <b>He even tears down the altar that Jeroboam had built in Bethel (up in Ephraim's territory).</b> Not only does he tear down the pagan altars to all the various false gods,<b> he slaughters those phony priests on their own altars.</b> There's a little slam against Solomon in II Kings 23:13; he's the one who started Israel's slide toward idolatry. Josiah is a very good king, but God had already determined that Judah would be destroyed because of the great sins of his fathers - especially Manasseh.</p>
<p>So, how wide spread was Josiah's influence in this clean-up operation? Take a look at II Chronicles 34:33, &quot;And Josiah <b>took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve</b>, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.&quot; We see the same confirmation in II Kings 23:19 where it is said that his eradication of pagan worship extended to all of the cities of Samaria, a reference to the territory once ruled by the Northern Kingdom of Israel. <b>Josiah! You're the man!</b></p>
		<p>Let's do a little assessment of the situation in Israel/Judah at this point. The year that these reforms began can be calculated to have begun around 620 B.C., in the 20th year of Josiah's reign. Josiah reigned until his death in 609 B.C., the same year that the Assyrians' Nineveh fell to the Babylonians. Assyria was significantly weakened at this point and had obviously lost its hold on Israel. Josiah is able to clean up the pagan worship in Judah AND Israel.<b> It would appear that all of Israel is unified under Josiah</b> (like in the old days), but because of Huldah's prophecy, Josiah knew that this prosperity was to be short lived. Judah/Israel had a tough time after the demise of Josiah; the capper comes in 586 B.C. when Judah, once and for all, fell to the Babylonians, seen in <a href="11-4.html#Jerusalem" title="II Kings 24-25 Summary" target="_blank">II Kings 24-25 (see notes)</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>What Josiah did here was a fulfillment of a 300-year-old prophecy that had been made to Jeroboam himself back in <a href="8-20.html#Jeroboam" title="I Kings 13 Summary" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a><strong>.</strong> As a matter of fact, Josiah is mentioned by name in that prophecy (I Kings 13:2). King Josiah fulfills this prophecy exactly as it had been presented to Jeroboam. </p>

22 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; <br>
23 But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem. <br>
24 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. <br>
25 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him. <br>
26 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal. <br>
27 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there. <br>
28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <br>
        </font></td>
        <td align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#cce1ff" width="66%"><font size="2">1 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. <br>
        2 And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD, <br>
        3 And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel, <br>
        4 And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son. <br>
        5 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites. <br>
        6 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses. <br>
        7 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king&rsquo;s substance. <br>
        8 And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen. <br>
        9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen. <br>
        10 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king&rsquo;s commandment. <br>
        11 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them. <br>
        12 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen. <br>
        13 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people. <br>
        14 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron. <br>
        15 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king&rsquo;s seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them. <br>
        16 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah. <br>
        17 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. <br>
        18 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <br>
        19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept. <br>

	<p>Inquiring minds may have been wondering why the law was just discovered during Josiah's reign. I mean...we all know that the law was kept inside the Ark of the Covenant; and we all know that the Ark of the Covenant was kept in the Holy of Holies. II Chronicles 35:3 gives us a little hint that the evil times under previous kings - especially Ahaz - may have caused the Levites to hide the Ark of the Covenant somewhere in the temple for safe keeping. The temple was a massive structure with underground rooms having plenty of places to hide such a treasure. Anyway, <b>Josiah tells them to put the Ark back into the Holy of Holies where it belongs. </b>Then Josiah restores the Passover followed by the 7 days of the Feast of Unleavened bread - just like ol' times with lots of sacrifices, singers - a glorious return to God. As a matter of fact, <b>according to II Chronicles 35:18, it was the mother of all</b> (so to speak)<b> passover observances. </b></p>
	<p>If you're looking for a resume enhancement on Josiah, there it is in II Kings 23:25, &quot;And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.&quot; Times were good, but there's a little wrinkle here in II Kings 23:26, &quot;Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, <strong>because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.</strong>&quot; In verse 27 we see that the Lord has already ordained that Judah and Jerusalem will fall, despite the good efforts of Josiah. Isaiah had prophesied that times would turn bad again.</p>

22 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. <br>
23 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded. <br>
24 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. <br>
25 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations. <br>

	<p>Things were going well in Israel/Judah under Josiah, but Josiah makes a miscalculation. It's about 609 B.C. (about 23 years before the final fall of Jerusalem). The King of Egypt is challenging the Assyrians and wants to cut across Judah on his way over to fight, but Josiah objects. The Egyptian king warns Josiah not to get involved; it's not his battle. Instead,<b> Josiah disguises himself and goes out to fight the King of Egypt; he's shot by an arrow and subsequently dies...and he was only 39 years old.</b> Everybody mourns his death.</p>
