		</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind; <br>
    2 And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about. <br>
    3 Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host. <br>
    4 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets. <br>
    5 For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel. <br>
    6 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD&rsquo;S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence. <br>
    7 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD&rsquo;S hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. <br>
    8 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed. <br>
    9 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies. <br>
    10 The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God. <br>
    11 Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple. <br>
    12 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon. <br>
    13 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness. <br>
    14 The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee. <br>
    15 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding. <br>
    16 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. <br>
    17 Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. <br>
    18 They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. <br>
    19 The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name. <br>
    20 Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms; <br>
    21 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; <br>
    22 With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid; <br>
    23 I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers. <br>
    24 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD. <br>
    25 Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain. <br>
    26 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD. <br>
    27 Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers. <br>
    28 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion. <br>
    29 And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant. <br>
    30 The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken. <br>
    31 One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end, <br>
    32 And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted. <br>
    33 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come. <br>
    34 Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out. <br>
    35 The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say. <br>
    36 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry. <br>
    37 And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant. <br>
    38 They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions&rsquo; whelps. <br>
    39 In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD. <br>
    40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats. <br>
    41 How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations! <br>
    42 The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. <br>
    43 Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby. <br>
    44 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall. <br>
    45 My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD. <br>
    46 And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler. <br>
    47 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her. <br>
    48 Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD. <br>
    49 As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth. <br>
    50 Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind. <br>
    51 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD&rsquo;S house. <br>
    52 Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan. <br>
    53 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from  me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD. <br>
    54 A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans: <br>
    55 Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered: <br>
    56 Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite. <br>
    57 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts. <br>
    58 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary. <br>
    59 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince. <br>
    60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon. <br>
    61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words; <br>
    62 Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever. <br>
    63 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates: <br>
    64 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chapter is a continuation of <a href="11-10.html#Babylon" title="Jeremiah 50 Summary" target="_blank">Jeremiah 50 (see notes)</a>; it's Jeremiah's prophecy against Babylon. And what a prophecy it is - 46 verses in chapter 50 and another 64 verses in chapter 51. Hey! The projected fall and total devastation of Babylon was a really, really big deal in Jeremiah's day. Who would have even imagined such a thing was possible back then? While happening over a period of time,<b> Babylon, after falling to the Persians, became a desolate city just as Jeremiah prophesied - completely uninhabited, structureless, and remained so until Saddam Hussein began his rebuilding project in the early 1980's.</b> He rebuilt Nebuchadnezzar's palace on the site where the original was, and he also built another huge palace for himself adjacent to it. By the time the U.S. Marines reached Babylon in 2003, the locals had already ravaged the palaces that had been rebuilt. <a title="Babylon's rebuilding" href="http://architecture.about.com/library/bl-babylon01.htm" target="_blank">If you'd like a photo tour to view Saddam Hussein's handy work in Babylon, click here.</a></p>
<p><b>And why was Babylon to be judged?</b> Look at verse 10; it was because they came up against Zion (Jerusalem). But wait; there's more! The Babylonian conquerors are identified in verse 11 as the Medes and the reason given for the impending fall of Babylon, &quot;...because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.&quot; That's the temple in Jerusalem being referenced there in Jeremiah's prophecy. Verse 24 mentions again that the retribution against Babylon is directly linked to their treatment of Jerusalem, and verse 28 once again refers to the hand of God in this retribution being the Medes. How many ways can Jeremiah paint the picture of Babylonian destruction? Answer: Several - just read beginning with verse 29 for the next several verses. Yup! Judgment is definitely coming to Babylon as God avenges Israel.</p>
		<p>Then we see Babylon's future in verse 43, &quot;Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.&quot; We see in verse 44 the collapse of Babylon's claim to fame - their great wall of the city and their recognition as the center of Bel (Baal) worship. Both will come to an end. Notice the promise of verse 49, &quot;As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.&quot; The Hebrew word for &quot;earth&quot; there is &quot;eretz&quot; which is translated &quot;earth&quot; or &quot;land.&quot; Here it is a reference to the land of the Babylonians. With the prominence of Babylon in the world during the time of this prophecy, it must have seemed a little far fetched for Jeremiah to prophesy their defeat, destruction and desolation by the Medes. <b>Once again, if you're looking for a prophet-validating prophecy, here you go. Jeremiah said it would happen, and it did...about 50 years later in 538 B.C. when the Medes came to town.</b></p>
		<p>Jeremiah gave directions to one of Zedekiah's government officials who was headed for Babylon in verses 59-64. He told him to read this prophecy aloud when he arrived. Afterward, he was to tie a rock to the scroll and throw it into the Euphrates as an object lesson to his audience. Then he was to repeat these words to the people, &quot;Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary.&quot;</p>

5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him. <br>

21 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years. </font></td>
            <td align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#cce1ff"><font color="#0000FF" size="2">4 And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king&rsquo;s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain. <br>
5 But the Chaldeans&rsquo; army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him. <br>
6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. <br>
7 Moreover he put out Zedekiah&rsquo;s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon. <br>
8 And the Chaldeans burned the king&rsquo;s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem. <br>
9 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained. <br>
10 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. </font></td>
            <td align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#cce1ff"><font size="2">7 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king&rsquo;s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain. <br>
8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. <br>
9 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him. <br>
10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. <br>
11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death. <br>
12 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem, <br>
13 And burned the house of the LORD, and the king&rsquo;s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire: <br>
14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about. <br>
15 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. <br>
16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen. <br>
17 Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. <br>
18 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. <br>
19 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away. <br>
20 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight. <br>
21 And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow. <br>
22 And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these. <br>
23 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about. <br>
24 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: <br>
25 He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king&rsquo;s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. <br>
26 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. <br>
27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land. <br>
28 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: <br>
29 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: <br>
30 In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred. <br>
31 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison, <br>
32 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon, <br>
33 And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life. <br>
34 And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life. </font></td>

		<p>The fall of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. was such a notable event in Jewish history, it is recorded four separate times in the Old Testament: <a title="II Kings 25; II Chronicles 36 Summary" href="11-3.html#Falls" target="_blank">Jeremiah 39:1-14 (see notes)</a>; and in this passage. It's like watching the rerun of a movie; it turns out the same way each time; Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar) wins.</p>
	<p><b>This historical chapter of Jerusalem's fall is divided up as follows:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The fall of Jerusalem (1-11)
              <br>
          Jerusalem was surrounded by Nebuchadnezzar's army for 18 months; the food was gone.<br>Verses 10-11 record the horrific treatment of King Zedekiah - killed his sons, blinded him, bound in him chains and put him into prison.						<li>The temple is plundered and burned; the walls around Jerusalem are broken down (12-23).		<li>The inhabitants are deported to Babylon (24-30)
<br>
				But first they took the leaders of Judah, including the High Priest and executed them.<br>
				Verses 28-30 record three different deportations over the next 16 years.
			

			
				
			
				
			
				
			
			<li>Jehoiachin (the king who preceded Zedekiah) is released from prison in Babylon after a 37-year stretch (31-34)<br>
				Jehoiachin was just 18 years old when he took over as king. Nebuchadnezzar replaced him after only three months with his 21 year-old uncle, Zedekiah. Nebuchadnezzar's successor, Evilmerodach, later on took care of Jehoiachin back in Babylon.
		</ul>
		<p><b>So, it's 586 B.C. and Israel is gone. </b>The wealthy and influential are deported to Babylon leaving just the poor. Jeremiah had prophesied that this exile would last 70 years. <a title="Jeremiah 25 Summary" href="10-27.html#News" target="_blank">(Click here to see the summary on that prophecy in Jeremiah 25:1-14.)</a> It was at that time that Cyrus, after having conquered Babylon, allowed the exiles to return to their land of Israel. However, it should be remembered that Israel was not autonomous as a nation at that time nor any time since until May 14, 1948. While some of the prophecies of the Old Testament prophets point to the return to the land under Cyrus, the accompanying revival and rule of the Messiah found in many passages is still a yet-future event for the Millennium.</p>
		<p><b>So. what can you say about Jeremiah?<font color="#ef0000"> It's better to be right than popular!</font></b></p>
