<p>After Josiah (640-609), there was not another good king of Judah. Jehoahaz (<a title="II Kings 23 Summary" href="10-17.html#Jehoahaz" target="_blank">II Kings 23:31-33, see notes</a>) was Josiah's third son and became Josiah's successor as King of Judah. Why Josiah's third son? II Chronicles 36:1 says, &quot;Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father&rsquo;s stead in Jerusalem.&quot; Apparently the people of Judah saw more hope in him than the other sons. However, Jehoahaz only reigned three months before he was deposed by Pharaoh-Necho from the throne, and carried away prisoner into Egypt; there he died in captivity. </p>
<p>Pharaoh-Necho placed Jehoiakim (originally named Eliakim before Pharaoh changed it) on the throne of Judah. He served from 609-598 and was Josiah's second son (two years older than Jehoahaz) as a puppet king subject to the Egyptians. Subsequently, Egypt and Judah were conquered by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. In the process, Jehoiakim was captured; he was prepared for the trip back to Babylon, but we do not know whether he was actually deported (<a href="#Jehoiachin">see discussion below</a>). This is the same time at which Daniel and his friends were taken to Babylon as well. Subsequently, Jehoiakim served as the puppet king, subject to the Babylonians. That's where we pick the story up here in II Kings 24. </p>
<p>Jehoiakim rebels against the Babylonians after three years. Jeremiah didn't have much use for Jehoiakim either (<a title="Jeremiah 22 Summary" href="11-2.html#Jehoiakim" target="_blank">Jeremiah 36:30, see notes</a>). His death is not well documented in scripture; we are only told in II Kings 24:6 that &quot;Jehoiakim slept with his fathers.&quot; In II Chronicles 36:6 we are told that Nebuchadnezzar &quot;bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon,&quot; but we aren't told that he actually made the trip to Babylon. However, the historian Josephus claimed that Jehoiakim met a violent death when he was thrown over the wall of Jerusalem right before the besieging Babylonian army to convince them that he was dead. Jehoiakim is succeeded by his son, Jehoiachin, but only for three months.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it should be noted in II Kings 24:3  that which we already knew when it says, &quot;Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, <strong>for the sins of Manasseh</strong>, according to all that he did.&quot; King Manasseh (695-642) had indulged in such atrocities during his reign, Judah was still paying the price. Even during the good reign of Josiah (640-609) it was reported in <a href="17-10.html#Passover" title="II Kings 23 Summary" target="_blank">II Kings 23:26 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, <strong>because of all the provocations that Manasseh</strong> had provoked him withal.&quot;</p>

<p>II Kings 24:8 reports that Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king after his father's (Jehoiakim) death. II Chronicles 36:9 says he was just eight. We have no way of knowing for certain, but perhaps the answer lies in II Chronicles 36:6. There we are told regarding Jehoiakim, &quot;Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, <strong>and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</strong>&quot; If Jehoiakim was actually taken to Babylon for a period of time and then returned later to his throne, it makes sense that his son, Jehoiachin, at just eight years of age, was regarded as the co-regent in his father's absence. Direct descendants were regarded as kings at any age. Furthermore, since there would have been no way of knowing whether or not Jehoiakim would ever return from Babylon, the people very likely regarded him as the new king after Jehoiakim's deportation. However, Jehoiakim did return, and upon doing so, resumed his role as king and perhaps shared the title with his son until his death. That would also lend understanding to how it could be determined that Jehoiachin was so evil after just three months.<br>
</p>
<p>Jehoiachin only has a three-month rule before he is deposed and taken to Babylon to live out the rest of his life. He was accompanied by his fellow government officials, mother and his wives. Jehoiachin had a couple of aliases in the Bible - Jechonias in <a href="11-11.html#End" target="_blank">Jeremiah 52:32-34, see notes</a>).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Jehoiachin doesn't put up a fight when the Babylonian army comes knockin' at the gate of Jerusalem; he just lets them in. They take everything of value. They also transport all the influential and skilled people in Jerusalem back to Babylon, including Jehoiachin, just as Jeremiah had prophesied (<a title="Jeremiah 22 Summary" href="10-26.html#Jehoiakim" target="_blank">Jeremiah 22:24-27, see notes</a>). This deportation system had been used by the Assyrians before, and now by the Babylonians; they, immediately upon conquering a nation, got the movers and shakers out of the land so as to destroy the national pride. That just left the poor people (verse 14). Subsequently they typically would bring the influential people in from other parts of their empire to inhabit their conquered land - in this case, Judah and Jerusalem.</p>

		<p>He is Jehoiachin's uncle (the last living son of Josiah) and is appointed puppet King of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar. In II Chronicles 36:10, Zedekiah in the KJV is called Jehoiachin's brother, but the Hebrew word (ach) used there can be translated brother or kinsman. We see here in II Kings 24:17 that Zedekiah was, in fact, Jehoiachin's uncle. After 11 years of this puppet thing, Zedekiah rebels against Babylon. There were lots of warnings to Zedekiah, but he wouldn't listen to Jeremiah or any of the other messengers God sent. II Chronicles 36:16 says, &quot;But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.&quot;</p>
	<p>I find interesting II Chronicles 36:13, &quot;And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, <strong>who had made him swear by God</strong>: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.&quot; Nebuchadnezzar apparently knew how special Jewish oaths were...or at least were supposed to be. Two chapters of the law are dedicated to the fulfillment of oaths/vows. <a href="7-5.html#Gibeonites" title="II Samuel 21 Summary" target="_blank">II Samuel 21:1-14 (see notes)</a>. Zedekiah apparently made an oath with Jehovah in the presence of Nebuchadnezzar that he would not rebel, but changed his mind.</p>

      4 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king&rsquo;s garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain. <br>
      5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him. <br>
      6 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him. <br>
      7 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon. <br>
      8 And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem: <br>
      9 And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king&rsquo;s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man&rsquo;s house burnt he with fire. <br>
      10 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about. <br>
      11 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away. <br>
      12 But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen. <br>
      13 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon. <br>
      14 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. <br>
      15 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away. <br>
      16 The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight. <br>
      17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work. <br>
      18 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: <br>
      19 And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king&rsquo;s presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city: <br>
      20 And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah: <br>
      21 And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land. <br>

19 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. <br>
20 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia: <br>

<p>The fall of Jerusalem and capture of Zedekiah is also seen in <a href="11-3.html#Falls" title="Jeremiah 39 Summary" target="_blank">Jeremiah 39 (see notes)</a>.<br>
  Nebuchadnezzar's not at all happy that Zedekiah won't continue to be his puppet king over Judah. He brings his army and blocks off the city from the outside world causing great famine in Jerusalem. The king and his &quot;men of war&quot; fled the city, but were not able to escape without Babylonian pursuit. King Zedekiah was captured. So, what do you do to your rebel king when he flexes his muscles? <b>Nebuchadnezzar makes Zedekiah watch the slaughter of his sons just before he puts his eyes out. Think about the last image Zedekiah saw. He then takes him captive and blind back to Babylon.</b> Then the Babylonians return to take away the rest of Judah's influential people (presumably those they missed before), leaving only very poor folks in Judah. They even take portions of the structure of the temple back to Babylon along with some of the sacred temple furniture. One last sweep of Judah brings forth a few more of Judah's leaders before Nebuchadnezzar, including Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, along with the three keepers of the door; he kills them too.</p>
<p>Let's give a special notice to II Chronicles 36:21, &quot;To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: <strong>for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.</strong>&quot; Jeremiah had prophesied that the exile from the land would last 70 years; that's what this verse is talking about. <a title="Jeremiah 29 Summary" href="10-29.html#Exiles" target="_blank">Click here to read a summary of the details regarding Jeremiah's exile prophecy.</a></p>

  <p><font size="2">22 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler. <br>
    23 And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. <br>
    24 And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you. <br>
    25 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah. <br>
    26 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees. <br>
