<p>This event follows the feeding of the five thousand recorded in <a href="3-6.html#Feeding" title="John 6 Summary" target="_blank">John 6:4 (see notes)</a> that the third Passover of Jesus' ministry was taking place. Now we find Jesus sending his disciples away, back toward Capernaum/Bethsaida (see map). Since they reach Gennesaret in Matthew 14:34/Mark 6:53 (<a href="#Touch">see below</a>), they are traveling along the shore from east to west.</p>
<p><font size="3">It is interesting that, while Matthew, Mark and John give the account of the story of Jesus walking on the water, <b>only Matthew tells us about Peter trying to duplicate the feat.</b> </font><font size="3">Obviously that wasn't the big story to John and Mark. John gives a great bit of detail to the subsequent fallout on the day following this miracle where we see that many of Jesus' disciples (not the twelve Apostles) cease following Jesus.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">They are<b> rowing against the wind</b> (about 3 to 3.5 miles out) and making little or no progress across the Sea of Galilee toward Capernaum/Bethsaida when Jesus (who had stayed behind to pray) walks by the ship...on the water. Matthew and Mark point out that the disciples thought at first that Jesus was a &quot;spirit&quot; (i.e. &quot;ghost&quot;). The Greek word used in Matthew 14:26 and Mark 6:49 is &quot;phantasma&quot; and is used only these two times in the New Testament. After everything they had seen Jesus do, why would a little Jesus water walking surprise them so? And why would it be easier to believe that they were seeing a ghost rather than Jesus actually walking on the water? Mark makes a noteworthy observation in Mark 6:52, &quot;For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.&quot; The term &quot;heart was hardened&quot; is only meant to convey to the reader that these disciples were having a difficult time equating the miracles of Jesus with the reality that he, as God, had power over the elements of the universe. <b>Even though they had viewed the reality-defying feat of feeding the five thousand, they were nonetheless amazed at a little bit of water walking.</b> Mark seems to find that aspect of the story amusing while Matthew finds amusing the fact that Peter tries his hand out at water walking as well. John gives the account, but makes a point that neither Matthew nor Mark mention in John 6:15 regarding Jesus' initial absence from the ship, &quot;When Jesus therefore perceived that <b>they would come and take him by force, to make him a king,</b> he departed again into a mountain himself alone.&quot; Only John felt that it was important to show <strong>WHY</strong> Jesus initially stayed back after sending the people away.</font></p>

27 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. <br>
28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? <br>
29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. <br>
30 They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work? <br>
31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. <br>
32 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. <br>
33 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. <br>
34 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. <br>
35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. <br>
36 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. <br>
37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. <br>
38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. <br>
39 And this is the Father&#146;s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. <br>
40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. <br>
41 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. <br>
42 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven? <br>
43 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. <br>
44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. <br>
45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. <br>
46 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father. <br>
47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. <br>
48 I am that bread of life. <br>
49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. <br>
50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. <br>
51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. <br>
52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? <br>
53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. <br>
54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. <br>
55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. <br>
56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. <br>
57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. <br>
58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. <br>

<p><strong>This episode takes place in the synagogue in Capernaum (verse 59) near the time of the Passover feast - one year before the crucifixion.</strong> Jesus had just miraculously fed the <font size="3">5,000 (<a title="Matthew 14:14-21; Mark 6:33-44; Luke 9:11-17; John 6:1-14 Summary" href="3-6.html#Feeding" target="_blank">Matthew 14:14-21; Mark 6:33-44; Luke 9:11-17; John 6:1-14, see notes</a>). </font>The teaching session becomes one of extreme doctrinal significance. The discussion turns to one of motivation when the people finally find Jesus. He points out to the crowd in verse 26, &quot;Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.&quot; That's an interesting observation Jesus shares with us: <b>Many of these followers were simply prosperity seekers.</b> They weren't interested in Jesus for any of the right reasons; they simply observed that he was able to take two fishes and five loaves and feed 5,000 with food left over. <b>Incidentally, this prosperity message is still being preached today.</b> <b>Many are following a message of  financial wealth and well being as their primary attraction to Jesus.</b> You will note that Jesus clearly establishes that this is not the proper motivation for following him.</p>
<p><b>&quot;Well, how about a sign then?&quot; the people asked.</b> You know...something akin to the manna God dropped from Heaven back in the wilderness wanderings. I'm reminded here of Paul's characterization of the Jews in <font size="3"><a title="I Corinthians 1 Summary" href="9-18.html#Motivation" target="_blank">II Corinthians 5:17 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.&quot; <b>I'd say that's a pretty significant renovation, wouldn't you?</b></p>
	<p><b>What's the differentiation here?</b> Here it is. <b>Salvation is not merely experiencing an enlightenment or saying some special words out loud.</b> <b>It's not just a determination to do right or a deep emotional experience of remorse. </b>All of these may accompany salvation, but <b>true salvation happens when God supernaturally, through the power of the Holy Spirit, draws a person to commit themselves completely to Jesus Christ as their ONLY means to God and Heaven.</b> When that process takes place,<b> it's permanent.</b> It says so right here in verse 35, &quot;shall never hunger&quot; and verse 37, &quot;I will in no wise cast out&quot; and in verse 39, &quot;I should lose nothing&quot; and in verse 40, &quot;have everlasting life.&quot; Incidentally, verse 37 includes a Greek double negative (&quot;ou me&quot;). That double-negative combination adds strength to the adamant guarantee, &quot;in no wise cast out.&quot; It's the equivalent of our oft-used slang term &quot;ain't no way!&quot; This phrase is actually used 94 times in the New Testament. </p>
	<p>Here's a very strong and decisive statement to the discussion in John 6:47, &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, <b>He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</b>&quot; So, how long is everlasting anyway? Until you sin? No! Everlasting is everlasting. <b>Salvation is a relationship - not a passing experience!</b> <b>When you trust Christ as your Savior, you enter into a permanent, eternal covenant with God whereby you are baptized by the Holy Spirit into the Body of Christ </b>(<a title="I Corinthians 12 Summary" href="9-6.html#Analogy" target="_blank">I Corinthians 12:13, see notes</a>). You become part of God's family. <b>Our shortcomings have no bearing on the integrity of that permanent relationship. </b></p>
	<p>Jesus is very clear in verses 34-35 with his metaphor for eating: He's clearly talking about believing on Jesus as Savior. In other words, <b>Bread of life = everlasting life.</b> Notice Jesus' reference in verse 45 to the New Covenant (<a title="Jeremiah 31 Summary" href="10-30.html#Covenant" target="_blank">Jeremiah 31:31-34, click here</a>), &quot;It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.&quot; Jesus refers to the fact that the future Kingdom on Earth that will be established will see a New Covenant established whereby all inhabitants of the earth are saved and living by faith. This concept is in stark contrast to the practice among the Jews in Jesus' day.</p>
		<p>Then Jesus caps off the discussion in John 6:58, &quot;This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.&quot; Manna is the supernatural bread that was supplied from God for forty years to Israel beginning in <a href="9-6.html#Ordinance" target="_blank">I Corinthians 11:23-26 (see notes)</a>.</p>

		<p>After this discussion, some of the seekers who had been following Jesus followed no more as we see in John 6:66, &quot;From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.&quot; <b> That statement has no implications regarding salvation whatsoever.</b> It's a simple statement regarding who continued to physically follow Jesus around in his ministry. However, what about the Twelve? Here's Peter's defining statement in John 6:68-69, &quot;Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; However, that was not the testimony of one there. Look at verse 70, &quot;Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?&quot; The Greek word for &quot;devil&quot; there is &quot;diabolos,&quot; from which we get our English word, &quot;diabolical.&quot; That word is usually translated &quot;devil,&quot; but is also sometimes translated &quot;accuser&quot; or &quot;slanderer.&quot; Since the definite article is not used here (i.e. <b>the</b> devil), it is not likely that Jesus is referring to Judas as the devil incarnate, but rather is identifying that one there (Judas) has motivations that are diabolical - the devil will be pleased; Jesus identifies that one one of them is there with evil motivations. <b>This puts to rest the notion that Judas<i> fell out </i>of a relationship with Jesus or<i> lost </i>his salvation.</b> Jesus clearly identifies that<b> Judas was chosen</b> as a disciple for a specific purpose, but was <b>evil from the beginning.</b> </p>
		<p>Let me say again: <b>Salvation and discipleship are two different relationships.</b> Would you not agree that verse 70 tells us that while<b> Judas WAS a disciple, he WAS NOT saved. </b>Let's not stop with Judas. Are there not a host of people in our world today who subscribe to the notion of emulating the life of Jesus, but who have not trusted Jesus Christ as their personal Savior? There are entire religions and denominations based upon this principle. Therefore, let me say it even once again: <b>Salvation and discipleship are two different relationships. The victorious Believer has both.</b> <a title="Matthew 16:24-27; Mark 8:34-38; Luke 9:23-26 Summary" href="03-18.html#Discipleship" target="_blank">If you want to read more about the difference between salvation and discipleship, click here to read the notes on Matthew 16:24-27; Mark 8:34-38; Luke 9:23-26.</a></p>
