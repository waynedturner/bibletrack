<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, <br>
    2 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls; <br>
    3 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies. <br>
    4 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.</font><font size="4"><b><br>

<p><font size="3">We're 13 months out of Egypt when God requires Moses to get a count of the fighting men of Israel. This count consists of all men above 20 years of age who are not Levites.</font> The Levites were exempt from military service.</p>
<p><strong>Step #1: Determine the names of the leaders of each tribe </strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">5 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur. <br>
    6 Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. <br>
    7 Of Judah; Nahshon the son of Amminadab. <br>
    8 Of Issachar; Nethaneel the son of Zuar. <br>
    9 Of Zebulun; Eliab the son of Helon. <br>
    10 Of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim; Elishama the son of Ammihud: of Manasseh; Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. <br>
    11 Of Benjamin; Abidan the son of Gideoni. <br>
    12 Of Dan; Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. <br>
    13 Of Asher; Pagiel the son of Ocran. <br>
    14 Of Gad; Eliasaph the son of Deuel. <br>
    15 Of Naphtali; Ahira the son of Enan. <br>
    16 These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><strong>Step #2: Arrange all the people under their tribal respective leader</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">17 And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by their names: <br>
    18 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls. <br>
    19 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><strong>Step #3: Count the men twenty years of age and older</strong></p>
<p><em>Reuben</em> - 46, 500</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">20 And the children of Reuben, Israel&rsquo;s eldest son, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; <br>

<blockquote>

    31 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Zebulun, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred. <br>
    </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>Ephraim - Joseph's son - 40,500</em></p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>

    39 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan, were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred. <br>
    </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>Asher</em> - 41,500</p>

    </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><strong>But what about the Levites - the sons of Levi?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">44 These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each one was for the house of his fathers. <br>
    45 So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel; <br>
    46 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. <br>
    47 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them. <br>
    48 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying, <br>
    49 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel: <br>
    50 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. <br>
    51 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. <br>
    52 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. <br>
    53 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony. <br>
    54 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">How appropriate that the Book of Numbers begins with...numbers. Here we're going to get a count of how many in each Tribe of Israel...with a couple of exceptions. Our count found here will <b>include only men</b> (20 years of age and older). And one more thing - <b>no Levites are counted here; </b>we'll get their count in <a title="Numbers 3-4 Summary" href="3-15.html#Levites" target="_blank">Numbers 3-4 (see notes)</a>. Why the age of 20? Verse 3 specifies, &quot;all that are able to go forth to war.&quot; The Levites were the keepers of the Tabernacle; they were special (verses 49-54).</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>So, here are your population figures for the Tribes of Israel 13 months after the Exodus:</b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font size="3">Reuben - 46,500</font>

			<li><font size="3">Judah - 74,600</font>

			<li><font size="3">Naphtali - 53,400</font>
		</ul>
		<p>This gives us a total of 603,550 men, 20 years of age and older. This total is also given in <a title="Exodus 38 Summary" href="2-25.html#Atonement" target="_blank">Exodus 38:21 (see notes)</a>, it seems to already be understood that the Levites have this special place among the Hebrews.</p>

		<p><font size="3">This chapter deals with the arrangement of the camp in the wilderness. I have prepared a visual below to illustrate the numeric strength of the tribes along with their positioning in the camp. You'll notice that on each side of the Tabernacle Judah, Reuben, Ephraim and Dan were each flanked by two other tribes. The formation was orderly and deliberate.</font></p>
<div align="center">
			<p><img src="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/image/Tribes_wilderness.gif" alt="Tribes of Israel in the Wilderness" height="508" width="616" border="0"></p>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p>Some observations are in order. You will notice that <b>Rachel's boys are positioned together on the west side</b> of the tabernacle. <b>Leah's boys are on the east and south side</b> of the tabernacle with one exception; <b>Gad (the son of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid) slips down into the open slot with Leah's two oldest sons, Reuben and Simeon on the south side.</b> <b>The remainder of the handmaids' sons reside together on the north side of the encampment.</b> Gad wasn't the oldest of the handmaids sons, but he was the oldest of Leah's handmaid. </p>
			<p>It's interesting that hundreds of years later, an order is still observed in keeping with the birth of Jacob's sons. As a matter of fact, there's also listed a lead tribe on each side of the encampment - Judah on the east, Reuben on the south, Ephraim on the west and Dan on the north. These are the senior sons of Jacob that take the lead with one exception - Ephraim. However, you will recall that when Jacob adopted the two boys (Manasseh and Ephraim) in <a title="Genesis 48:5-22 Summary" href="2-8.html#Jacob" target="_blank">Genesis 48:5-22 (see notes)</a>, he gave the elder-son birthright to the younger son, Ephraim instead. So...there you have the logic behind the positioning of the Tribes of Israel around the tabernacle.</p>
