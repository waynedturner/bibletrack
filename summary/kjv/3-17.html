<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them; <br>
    2 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered: <br>
    3 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle. <br>
    4 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
    5 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service. <br>
    6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. <br>
    7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service: <br>
    8 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. <br>
    9 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders. <br>
    10 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar. <br>
    11 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Let's get started by putting this chapter into perspective with regard to <b>the correct time frame.</b> You will recall back in <a title="Exodus 40 Summary" href="2-27.html#Setup" target="_blank"><b>Exodus 40</b> (see notes)</a><b> that Moses took delivery of the Tabernacle, erected it and subsequently God filled it with his presence. </b>In this chapter we find the <b>dedication of that Tabernacle that immediately followed.</b> We see them rolling into camp in wagons. <b>Twelve princes in six wagons; they carpooled - two to a wagon.</b> The wagons and sacrifices were turned over to the priests for service. Of the Levites, the Gershonites received two of the wagons, the Merarites received the other four wagons. <b>The Kohathites got no wagons.</b> Why? It was because their responsibilities in moving the Tabernacle consisted of carrying the sacred vessels of the Tabernacle; these vessels were transported on foot, not wagons.</font></p>
<p>The Jewish holiday of Hanukkah celebrates the purification and rededication of the Jerusalem Temple by the Maccabees in the second century B.C. This is an eight-day celebration, and portions of the daily readings are taken from Numbers 7 because this chapter contains the record of the original dedication of the tabernacle.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>The presentation of the gifts to the priests (Numbers 7:12-83)<br>
				</b></font><b>First of all, let's recall the listing of the heads of the Tribes of Israel at the census that began in </b><a title="Numbers 1 Summary" href="3-13.html#Reckon" target="_blank"><b>Numbers 1</b> (see notes)</a> is not the same order in which they presented their offerings to the priests. Any significance? Upon closer inspection, you will recognize that they did so in the order in which they were positioned around the Tabernacle in their groups of three. <a title="Wilderness Arrangement" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/image/Tribes_wilderness.gif" target="_blank">(See the illustration of that arrangement)</a><b> They are listed in that order going clockwise around the tabernacle, beginning on the east side. </b></p>
<p>Each of the princes of the 12 Tribes of Israel brought the same gifts. Could this be the origin of the classic 12-place setting sold in stores everywhere to this day? Maybe not. <b>Every group of 6 verses from 12 to 83 provides the exact same description of items presented as follows:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>one silver platter weighing about 1.5 kilograms
  <li>one silver sprinkling bowl weighing about 0.8 kilogram
  <li>one gold ladle (spoon) weighing about 110 grams
  <li>the plate and bowl contained flour mixed with oil for a grain offering
  <li>the ladle was filled with incense
  <li>one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb for a burnt offering
