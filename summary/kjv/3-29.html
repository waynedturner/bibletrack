    <p><font size="4">As Israel is preparing themselves to enter into Canaan and possess the land at this point in Numbers, it is important for them to have an impeccable relationship with God. Their prescribed offerings to God are restated here in Numbers 28-29 to keep before them their dependence on God.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Daily Offerings (Numbers 28:1-8)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
	      2 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season. <br>
	      3 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering. <br>
	      4 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even; <br>
	      5 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil. <br>
	      6 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. <br>
	      7 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering. <br>
	      8 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer IT, A SACRIFICE MADE BY FIRE, OF A SWEET SAVOUR UNTO THE LORD. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
		<p><b>Every morning and evening, a lamb had to be sacrificed.</b> This was a communal offering made on behalf of the people. It is a restatement of the same sacrifices specified in <a title="Exodus 29 Summary" href="2-21.html#Consecration" target="_blank">Exodus 29:38-43 (see notes)</a> on the occasion of the consecration of the newly-erected tabernacle. Verse 4 specifies, &quot;The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;&quot;<b> That's two lambs a day.</b> &quot;Why?&quot; you say. Exodus 29:43 says, &quot;And there I will meet with the children of Israel, <b>and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.</b>&quot;</p>
<p><a name="Sabbath"></a><font size="4"><b>Sabbath Offerings (Numbers 28:9-10) <br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">9 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: <br>
    10 This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone dwelling among the Israelites is required by this statute to observe the sabbath, according to <a title="Exodus 31 Summary" href="2-23.html#Sabbath" target="_blank">Exodus 31:12&#150;18</a><a title="Exodus 31 Summary" href="2-23.html#Sabbath" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a>. Again, this is a communal offering made on behalf of the people. It involved the sacrifice of <b>two more lambs on each regular sabbath day. </b>This additional offering on the sabbath is specified here for the first time. It is interesting to note that the sabbath day was not a day of corporate worship for the Hebrews, but rather a day of rest.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>The inclusion of a new moon offering only appears in this chapter.</b> The new moon began a new month for Israel. This communal offering is placed on a par with other major festivals with its sacrifice of a larger number of valuable animals (two bulls, a ram and seven sheep) and the addition of a sacrificial goat as a sin offering. Incidentally, the ancient calendar was an observational calendar based upon the appearance of a new moon to indicate the first day of the successive month. If you looked out your tent window and saw this sacrifice taking place, the old month was gone and the new one had begun. <a title="Jewish Calendar" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Jewish_calendar.html" target="_blank">For more information on the observational calendar see the information box to the right or click here.</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>The Feast of Unleavened Bread is celebrated during the seven days after Passover. </b>We first saw it in <a title="Exodus 12 Summary" href="2-13.html#Passover" target="_blank">Exodus 12:14-20 (see notes)</a>. This festival <b>marked the beginning of the barley harvest</b> (March-April). Unleavened bread was made from the newly harvested grain without adding yeast and was eaten as the first sign of coming harvests that year. The first day of this seven-day festival and the seventh day were <b>no-work days</b>. On the first day, two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year were offered along with a goat. This communal offering falls on the heels of the individual Passover lamb slain by each family the previous day.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Offerings for the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) (Numbers 28:26-31)<br>

			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">26 Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: <br>
    27 But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year; <br>
    28 And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram, <br>
    29 A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs; <br>
    30 And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you. <br>
    31 Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink offerings. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font size="3">This festival is also called the day of first fruits, celebrating the end of the barley harvest </font>and was also known as Pentecost. </b>It fell fifty days after the regular sabbath day of the week following Passover (always a Sunday). That 50 caused it to inherit the name &quot;Pentecost&quot; in the Greek language to indicate it's reference to the Passover. The Hebrew word for &quot;weeks&quot; here is the same word used by Daniel in referencing the weeks of years in <a title="Daniel 9 Summary" href="12-12.html#Weeks" target="_blank">Daniel 9:24-27 (see notes)</a>. Therefore, to put this into perspective, this day fell exactly 7 sevens or 49 days after the Feast of Firstfruits (both on a Sunday). So, to call it the Feast of Sevens rather than the Feast of Weeks gives us a better idea of how it got it's name. It gets a lot of attention in scripture (<a title="Exodus 23 Summary" href="2-19.html#Rest" target="_blank">Exodus 23:16, see notes</a>; <a title="Leviticus 23 Summary" href="3-9.html#Feasts" target="_blank">Leviticus 23:15-21, see notes</a>; <a title="Deuteronomy 16 Summary" href="4-10.html#Feasts" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 16:9-12, see notes</a>). You may also recall the<b> big happenings in </b><a title="Acts 2 Summary" href="7-4.html#Pentecost" target="_blank"><b>Acts 2 </b>(see notes)</a><b> on this very day when the Holy Spirit was manifested and the church in Jerusalem was established.</b> This festival was the first big gathering of Jews after the crucifixion which had taken place on Passover. Another communal offering was made consisting of two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year along with a goat.</p>

<p><font size="3">On the <b>tenth day of the seventh month</b> the Jews observed the Day of Atonement (aka Yom Kippur), when all sin was put away (<a title="Leviticus 16 Summary" href="3-7.html#Day" target="_blank">Leviticus 16:1-34, see notes</a>). It's observance is also specified in <a title="Leviticus 23 Summary" href="3-9.html#Feasts" target="_blank">Leviticus 23:26-32 (see notes)</a>. This was the only occasion in the year when the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, and the whole congregation fasts in verse 7 where they are told to &quot;afflict your souls.&quot; That phrase is used to indicate a fast in <a href="10-9.html#Fasting" title="Isaiah 58 Summary" target="_blank">Isaiah 58 (see notes)</a>. They were also to refrain from work on this day, as it was a <b>no-work day</b>. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Ark of the Covenant disappeared prior to Jerusalem's fall in 586 B.C. In Jesus' day, there was no mercy seat in the Holy of Holies of the Temple. We're told by extra-biblical sources that there was just a big rock in there. Today's Jews don't even have a temple. All that remains of this special day today (Yom Kippur) is the fasting; no sacrificing of animals is done. It is still observed by most practicing Jews, but quite differently from the pattern of observance specified here in scripture.<br>

<p><font size="3">Here's another <b>no-work day</b> on the <b>fifteenth day of the seventh month</b>. It is also referred to as the &quot;Feast of Booths&quot; or by its Hebrew designation, &quot;Sukkot.&quot; This was the final harvest of the year and occurred in the autumn prior to the onset of the rainy season marking the beginning of a new agricultural year. This seven-day festival was also referred to as the Feast of Ingathering in </font><a title="Exodus 23 Summary" href="2-19.html#Rest" target="_blank">Exodus 23:16 (see notes)</a><font size="3">; it is symbolized by the construction of booths. The first day of this festival was a no-work day. Offered were thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs along with a goat. Over the seven-day period there are substantially more sacrifices made to commemorate this annual festival. We find more information about this festival in </font><a title="Leviticus 23 Summary" href="3-9.html#Feasts" target="_blank">Leviticus 23:33-43 (see notes)</a><font size="3">. Of special interest here is Leviticus 23:42-43, &quot;Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.&quot; They all stayed in these booths for seven days each year during this festival to commemorate their wanderings after their exodus from Egypt. <b>Hey!

<p>This was also the day selected for the <b>dedication of Solomon's Temple</b> (<a title="I Kings 8 Summary" href="8-7.html#Sacrifice" target="_blank">I Kings 8:65, see notes</a>). When the exiles returned to Israel in <a href="12-28.html#Time" title="Nehemiah 8 Summary" target="_blank">Nehemiah 8:13-18 (see notes)</a>, they determined to observe this festival.

    3 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father&rsquo;s house in her youth; <br>
    4 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. <br>
    5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her. <br>
    6 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; <br>
    7 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. <br>
    8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her. <br>
    9 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her. <br>
    10 And if she vowed in her husband&rsquo;s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath; <br>
    11 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. <br>
    12 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her. <br>
    13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. <br>
    14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. <br>
    15 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity. <br>
    16 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father&rsquo;s house. </font></p>

<p>We looked at the value of vows back in <a title="Vows Summary" href="3-12.html#Vows" target="_blank">Leviticus 27 (see notes)</a>. Here in Numbers 30, we see some criteria regarding vows. <b>A vow given in Israel was a serious matter.</b> Note the declaration regarding a vow by a man in verse 2, &quot;...he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.&quot; We see the subordinate position of women in Israel in verse 3-16. If a woman under her father's care uttered a vow, her father could void that vow if done so that day. Likewise, the husband of a married woman could void a vow. Widows and divorced women must stand by their vows (verse 9). </p>
<p>We find a warning regarding vows in <a title="Deuteronomy 23 Summary" href="4-13.html#Laws" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 23:21-23 (see notes)</a>, &quot;<b>When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: </b>for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee. But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.&quot; Notice what Solomon said about these voluntary vows in Ecclesiastes 5:4-5, &quot;<b>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it;</b> for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. <b>Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</b>&quot; </p>
<p><b>Samuel was Hannah's vow to God in <a title="I Samuel 1 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=05&dy=11" target="_blank">I Samuel 1</a></b><a title="I Samuel 1 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=05&dy=11#Hannah" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a> prior to her conception. She subsequently presented him to the High Priest for service to God. And <b>who can forget Jephthah's foolish, unscriptural vow</b> in <a title="Judges 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=05&dy=04#Jephthah" target="_blank">Judges 11 (see notes)?</a> You will notice that <b>offering a human as a burnt offering WAS NOT part of the regulations of </b><a title="Vows Summary" href="3-12.html#Vows" target="_blank"><b>Leviticus 27</b> (see notes)</a><b>; it was clearly a violation of the Law of Moses.</b> While completely contrary to God's law, it does show us how seriously the Hebrews took their vows.</p>
<p>To accentuate this point on vows, consider the vow that Joshua was deceived into accepting with regard to the Gibeonites in&nbsp;<a href="4-22.html#Oath" title="Joshua 9 Summary" target="_blank">Joshua 9 (see notes)</a>. Centuries later, under King David's rule in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=7&dy=5#Gibeonites" title="I Samuel 21 Summary" target="_blank">I Samuel 21 (see notes)</a>, Israel experiences a drought from God because King Saul had disregarded the vow that Joshua had made regarding these Gibeonites. As I said, a vow is a very serious matter with God.</p>
