<p><a name="Once"></a><font size="4"><b>Once is enough! (Deuteronomy 24:1-4)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">1 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.<br />
2 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man&rsquo;s wife.<br />
3 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;<br />
4 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s a provision under the Mosaic Law that <b>restricts a man from remarrying a woman after his divorce from her</b> and her subsequent remarriage to another man. It would appear that this law is designed to protect the second marriage from emotions which may be potentially revived between the original marriage partners. This is a bridge-burning law that says,<b> &quot;You can&#39;t go back!&quot;</b></p>

<p>What might this &quot;uncleanness&quot; of verse 1 involve? After all, the realization that a Hebrew woman wasn&#39;t a virgin after one marries her is dealt with in <a href="4-13.html#Betrothal" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 22 Summary">Deuteronomy 22:13-30 (see notes)</a>, and the penalty for this unfaithfulness was stoning to death - no divorce required there. Likewise, death by stoning is the outcome specified for adultery in <a href="3-16.html#Adultery" target="_blank" title="Numbers 5 Summary">Numbers 5:11-31 (see notes)</a>. However, there are at least a couple of situations that come to mind where a woman taken in marriage may not be a virgin. In <a href="2-19.html#Laws" target="_blank" title="Exodus 22 Summary">Exodus 22:16-17 (see notes)</a> we see a situation where an innocent woman is no longer a virgin. Another scenario might be the woman taken prisoner and subsequently taken as a wife by her Hebrew captor as seen in <a href="4-13.html#Wife" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 21 Summary">Deuteronomy 21:10-14 (see notes)</a>. In both instances we have the possibility that one might marry a woman who was not a virgin at marriage and become dissatisfied afterward because of the discovered &quot;uncleanness.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Miscellaneous"></a><font size="4"><b>Miscellaneous laws (Deuteronomy 24:5-22)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">5 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.<br />
6 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh a man&rsquo;s life to pledge.<br />
7 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.<br />
8 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.<br />
9 Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.<br />
10 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.<br />
11 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.<br />
12 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:<br />
13 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.<br />
14 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:<br />
15 At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.<br />
16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.<br />
17 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow&rsquo;s raiment to pledge:<br />
18 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.<br />
19 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.<br />
20 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.<br />
21 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.<br />
22 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing. </font></p>

	The millstone was made up of two stones, a really big stone as the base with a small stone of five pounds or so that fit one&#39;s hand for the purpose of grinding grain. A poor person depended upon this tool for his food. This tool could not be taken as security for a loan.</li>

<p>While the Hebrews were the covenant people (their relationship with God), it is interesting to note the provisions made in the Law of Moses for foreigners. Notice verses 17, 18, 20 and 21. As a matter of fact, notice <a href="4-8.html#Transplant" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 10 Summary">Deuteronomy 10:19 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.&quot; This generosity stopped short, however, of ever being king over Israelites (<a href="4-12.html#Rules" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 17 Summary">Deuteronomy 17:15, see notes</a>), and a Hebrew COULD charge interest on a loan to a stranger, but NOT a fellow Hebrew (<a href="4-13.html#Laws" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 23 Summary">Deuteronomy 23:20, see notes</a>). Another interesting provision for the foreigner living among the Hebrews was that he could be given certain foods to eat that were unclean to the Hebrews and forbidden (<a href="4-10.html#Food" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 14 Summary">Deuteronomy 14:21, see notes</a>).</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Ouch! Forty will do! (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">1 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.<br />
2 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.<br />
3 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">A beatin&#39; has an upper limit of 40 whacks. I guess that&#39;s some consolation. Rabbis in the first century decreed 39 stripes instead of 40; they wanted to be certain there was a margin for error so as to not exceed the letter of the law in case of a miscount. The Apostle Paul was so beaten five times according to his own words in <a href="9-22.html#False" target="_blank" title="II Corinthians 11 Summary">II Corinthians 11:24 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.&quot; In the case of these Law-prescribed beatings, the judge was to oversee the beating as the beatee was to lie, face down, on the ground for the punishment.</font></p>

<p title="I Corinthians 9 Summary"><a name="Oxen"></a><font size="4"><b>Let the oxen eat while they work! (Deuteronomy 25:4)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p title="I Corinthians 9 Summary"><font size="2">4 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p title="I Corinthians 9 Summary">Paul makes reference to this verse when talking about preachers getting paid in <a href="10-28.html#Instructions" target="_blank" title="I Timothy 5 Summary">I Timothy 5:18 (see notes)</a>, &quot;For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.&quot; Paul also quotes this verse in <a href="9-2.html#Apostle" target="_blank">I Corinthians 9:<font size="3">9 (see notes)</font></a><font size="3">, &quot;For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?&quot;</font></p>

<p><a name="Wife"></a><font size="4"><b>But I don&#39;t want my brother&#39;s wife! (Deuteronomy 25:5-10)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">5 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband&rsquo;s brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband&rsquo;s brother unto her.<br />
6 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.<br />
7 And if the man like not to take his brother&rsquo;s wife, then let his brother&rsquo;s wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband&rsquo;s brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband&rsquo;s brother.<br />
8 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;<br />
9 Then shall his brother&rsquo;s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother&rsquo;s house.<br />
10 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Israel, it was your family obligation after your brother&#39;s untimely death to take his wife and give her an opportunity to bear a child. So, you refuse? Better get ready for some public humiliation then...in front of the whole city. The dead brother&#39;s name would be continued through the birth of the son conceived under this provision of the Law.</p>

<p><b>This procedure was not new under Mosaic Law. </b>We first get a glimpse of this brotherly responsibility in <a href="2-3.html#Struggle" target="_blank" title="Genesis 38 Summary">Genesis 38 (see notes)</a> with Judah and his first son, Er. We then see this scenario played out between Ruth and Boaz in the <a href="5-10.html" target="_blank" title="Ruth Summary">Book of Ruth (see notes)</a>. Some have sought to make this law socially compatible with contemporary standards by specifying that the obligation existed only when the brother had not previously married prior to his brother&#39;s death. There is no scriptural evidence to support this notion. In fact, providing an heir was the issue here. The widow needed an heir for her dead husband, and the remaining brother was obligated to provide that heir in his brother&#39;s name - without regard to the one or more wives he might already have. In Hebrew culture, marriages under these circumstances are known as &quot;levirate&quot; marriages.</p>

<p>A property-rights issue is probably in view here. If a widow without children marries outside of her husband&#39;s clan, that portion of the family inheritance of land may end up in the hands of another clan. This insures that the property stays where it was intended. Incidentally, the special circumstances of this law overrides the stipulations of <a href="3-7.html#Taboos" target="_blank" title="Leviticus 18 Summary">Leviticus 18:16 (see notes)</a> and <a href="3-8.html#Category" target="_blank" title="Leviticus 20 Summary">Leviticus 20:21 (see notes)</a>. Both of those passages forbid one from marrying his brother&#39;s wife.</p>

<p>Jesus touches on the provisions of this law when asked a question by the Sadducees (<a href="5-9.html#Sadducees" target="_blank" title="Matthew 22; Mark 12; Luke 20 Summary">Matthew 22:23-33; Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40 - see notes</a>).</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Wives, stay out of your husband&#39;s fight! (Deuteronomy 25:11-12)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">11 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:<br />
12 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Ouch! </font>A wife can lose a hand by coming to the aid of her husband in a fight...if she&#39;s not careful. Punch, kick, bite, scratch if she likes, but she must be careful about the bodily location of her aggression.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Don&#39;t you dare pull out those phony scales! (Deuteronomy 25:13-16)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">13 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.<br />
14 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small.<br />
15 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.<br />
16 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Inaccurate scales are illegal, and it&#39;s illegal to cheat someone by deliberately falsely weighing the product. Interesting...consumer protection laws even back then. Specifically, if one were buying, he might have pulled out a heavier weight to balance it on his scales against the product he was purchasing - getting more for his money. On the other hand, if he were selling, he might pull out the lesser weight against which he balanced the product, thus giving less product for the purchase price. That was illegal under Mosaic Law.</font></p>

<p><a name="Amalek"></a><font size="4"><b>We&#39;re never forgetting Amalek! (Deuteronomy 25:17-19)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">17 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;<br />
18 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.<br />
19 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The Amalekites...t</font>hey hate us, and we&#39;re not crazy about them. Remember when God judged Israel for refusing to go take Canaan after the return of the 12 spies in Numbers 14. They decided to try to reverse God&#39;s judgment by going up against the Amalekites into Canaan by their own might and were thoroughly whipped in battle (<a href="3-21.html#Israel" target="_blank" title="Numbers 14 Summary">Number 14:39-45, see notes</a>). However, <b>the reference here looks back to their immediate exodus from Egypt when the Amalekites dogged them in <a href="2-16.html#War" target="_blank" title="Exodus 17 Summary">Exodus 17:8-13</a></b><a href="2-16.html#War" target="_blank" title="Exodus 17 Summary"> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> That was Israel&#39;s first big battle, and they prevailed.

<p>According to the Jewish Study Bible, &quot;These verses are read liturgically on the Sabbath before Purim, since according to Jewish tradition, Haman, the evil protagonist of Esther, is an Amalekite (see 1 Sam. 15:8 and Esth. 8:3).&quot;</p>

<p>They were not to just take their offerings and leave - had to recite to the officiating priest the history lesson of their people going back to Jacob, the Aramean/Syrian (verses 5-9). This all took place back at the location of the tabernacle. <b>Every third year the tithe was taken </b>and given for the provision of the poor and Levites (verse 12) - probably not taken to the central location of the tabernacle, but to a place designated by each tribe. There was a ritual saying that went with this offering as well (verses 13-15) which offered a commitment to God and expressed thankfulness for his provisions. Again, notice that this was a mandatory tithe which, in effect, was how the government provided for the needs of their government servants and poor.</p>

<p>For more on this every-third-year tithe, <a href="4-10.html#Tithing" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 14 Summary">see the notes on Deuteronomy 14:22-29</a>.</p>

<p>The second giving of the Law is now complete. These four verses cap it off with an exhortation to adhere carefully to the stipulations of the covenant the Lord has established with the Hebrews. The special status of the Hebrew people before God is once again stated in these verses.</p>

<p>Remember the Gerizim/Ebal (<a href="4-10.html#Love" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 11 Summary">Deuteronomy 11 (see notes</a>) with <b>2,000,000+ Hebrews shouting their acceptance of the cursings and blessings of the law?</b> Here are some more specific instructions about how this event is to take place, which doesn&#39;t actually happen until Joshua 8. Hey! Be patient; <b>it takes time to put together a 2,000,000-voice choir.</b> The actual event takes place in<a href="4-21.html#Event" target="_blank" title="Joshua 8 Summary"> Joshua 8:29-35 (see notes)</a>. It&#39;ll be an earth-shaking vocal experience!</p>

<p>The advance team will write &quot;all the words of this law&quot; (verse 3) upon stones on the other side of Jordan before this big event. These two mountain tops are about one mile apart over on the Canaan side of the Jordan River. Half of the Hebrew tribes will stand on Mount Ebal (Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali); the other half will stand on Mount Gerizim (Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:). The Levites will read the curses, and the people on the mountains will cry &quot;amen.&quot; Verses 15-26 list those curses which are to be read at that big gathering. We&#39;ll see the reading of the blessings with additional curses in <a href="4-16.html#Obey" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 28 Summary">Deuteronomy 28 (see notes)</a>.</p>
