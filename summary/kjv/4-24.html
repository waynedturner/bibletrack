				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east: <br>
    2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; <br>
    3 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah: <br>
    4 And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, <br>
    5 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. <br>
    6 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh. <br>
    7 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions; <br>
    8 In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: <br>
    9 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; <br>
    10 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; <br>
    11 The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; <br>
    12 The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; <br>
    13 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; <br>
    14 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; <br>
    15 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; <br>
    16 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; <br>
    17 The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; <br>
    18 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; <br>
    19 The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; <br>
    20 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; <br>
    21 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; <br>
    22 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one; <br>
    23 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one; <br>
    24 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's recap all those kings defeated by Moses (verses 1-6) and Joshua (verses 7-24). There were 31 altogether according to verse 24 under Joshua, not counting Og and Sihon under Moses. We find the defeat of Kings Og and Sihon on the east side of the Jordan in <a title="Numbers 21 Summary" href="4-22.html#Fighting" target="_blank">Joshua 10-11 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Wait"></a><font size="4"><b>But wait; there's more! (Joshua 13)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed. <br>
    2 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri, <br>
    3 From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites: <br>
    4 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites: <br>
    5 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath. <br>
    6 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee. <br>
    7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, <br>
    8 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them; <br>
    9 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon; <br>
    10 And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon; <br>
    11 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; <br>
    12 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out. <br>
    13 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day. <br>
    14 Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them. <br>
    15 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families. <br>
    16 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba; <br>
    17 Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon, <br>
    18 And Jahazah, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, <br>
    19 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley, <br>
    20 And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth, <br>
    21 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country. <br>
    22 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them. <br>
    23 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof. <br>
    24 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families. <br>
    25 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah; <br>
    26 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir; <br>
    27 And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward. <br>
    28 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages. <br>
    29 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families. <br>
    30 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities: <br>
    31 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families. <br>
    32 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward. <br>
    33 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;There's a lot more to do!&quot; God reminds Joshua as he points out that Joshua is old. Verses 1-7 indicate the land that is yet to be conquered, and then we get a recap of the land already allocated to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh in verse 8-12. Verse 13 tells us that <b>a couple of Canaanite tribes were not driven out</b> as God had commanded. Interestingly enough, we see from <a title="II Samuel 3 Summary" href="6-29.html#Absalom" target="_blank">II Samuel 13:37 (see notes)</a>. </p>
<p>Notice that the Tribe of Manasseh gets split up by the Jordan River. As a matter of fact, Manasseh is often referred to as the &quot;half-tribe&quot; in the Old Testament. Some have mistakenly thought that the designation referred to the fact that both Manasseh and Ephraim were sons of one of the twelve sons of Jacob, Joseph. Instead, however, the &quot;half-tribe&quot; designation refers to the fact that half of the tribe inhabited land on the east side of the Jordan River with Reuben and Gad, while the other half inhabited land on the west side of the Jordan River. As such, they functioned independently.</p>
<p>This agreement for Reuben, Gad and half of Manasseh to inhabit land on the east side of the Jordan River was negotiated with Moses back in <a href="3-31.html#Reuben" title="Numbers 32 Summary" target="_blank">Numbers 32 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><b>We get a detailed recap of property allocated to Reuben and Gad...and of course half of Manasseh on the east side of the Jordan River in verses 15-32.</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The inheritance of Reuben (13:15-23)
			<li>The inheritance of Gad (13:24-28)
			<li>The inheritance of the half-tribe of Manasseh (13:29-31)
		</ul>
		<p>Two references in this chapter are made to the Tribe of <b>Levi</b> (verses 14 and 33) - <b>STILL left out of the property allocation;</b> God himself is their inheritance.</p>

		<p><a name="Clarification"></a><font size="4"><b>How about another clarification on which tribes stayed east of the Jordan River (Joshua 14:1-5)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them. <br>
	      2 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe. <br>
	      3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them. <br>
	      4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance. <br>
	      5 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
		<p><font size="3">Here's an overview of the allotment. </font>So, half of Manasseh, Gad and Reuben settled east of the Jordan. And...again...the Levites get nothing. Repetition is the key to learning.</p>
<p><a name="Caleb"></a><font size="4"><b>Old man Caleb calls in his marker from 45 years ago (Joshua 14:6-15)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">6 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea. <br>
    7 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart. <br>
    8 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God. <br>
    9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children&rsquo;s for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God. <br>
    10 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old. <br>
    11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in. <br>
    12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be WITH ME, THEN I SHALL BE ABLE TO DRIVE THEM OUT, AS THE LORD said. <br>
    13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance. <br>
    14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel. <br>
    15 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He may be 85 years old, but his memory is great. <b>Caleb wants what was promised to him by Moses 45 years ago.</b> The only reference we have to this promise is in <a title="Deuteronomy 1 Summary" href="3-20.html#Grasshopper" target="_blank">Numbers 13 (see notes)</a>. He has just reviewed how that this rebellion caused a whole generation of men to die off without seeing the promised land, &quot;Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.&quot; Keep in mind, only two men (except for Levites) are above 60 years of age - Joshua and Caleb. Joshua said, &quot;You take it, and it's yours!&quot; He was old, but he was feisty; he took Hebron for his inheritance. Hebron was just south of Jerusalem on the same mountain range within the territory given to the Tribe of Judah, his native tribe.</p>
<p><b>Caleb gives us some valuable historical information regarding the length of time it took to conquer Canaan</b>...or at least up to this point in time. Note verse 10, &quot;And now, behold, the LORD <b>hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years,</b> even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, <b>I am this day fourscore and five years old.&quot; </b>From this verse we can calculate that <b>the conquest of Canaan so far has taken seven years since they began,</b> calculated as follows: 38 years in the wilderness since the return of the spies which Caleb states was 45 years ago. That's a difference of seven years.</p>
		<p><a name="Judah"></a><font size="4"><b>The Tribe of Judah gets its property allocation (Joshua 15:1-12)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast. <br>
	      2 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward: <br>
	      3 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa: <br>
	      4 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast. <br>
	      5 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan: <br>
	      6 And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: <br>
	      7 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel: <br>
	      8 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward: <br>
	      9 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim: <br>
	      10 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah: <br>
	      11 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea. <br>
	      12 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families. </font></p>

		<p>So, what did Judah get for their inheritance? These verses read like the legal description on a deed.</p>

<p>Caleb's daughter, Achsah, must have been quite attractive. 85-year-old Caleb said that the man who conquers Kiriath-sepher gets to marry his daughter. Turns out, her first cousin, Othniel, does the job and earns his bride. She makes a request of her Dad though - running water (verse 19). Nothing too good for my daughter! Caleb complies - gives her &quot;<font size="3">the upper springs, and the nether springs.&quot;</font> We get a recap of this story in <a href="4-30.html#Othniel" title="Judges 3 Summary" target="_blank">Judges 3:7-11 (see notes)</a> that Othniel would later become the first judge of Israel.</p>

    62 And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages. <br>
    63 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day. </font></p>

<p>Judah got a proportionally larger territory than would seem justified based upon their population. <b>These verses show us how the individual clans within Judah were allocated real estate.</b> How about those pesky Jebusites? Some folks just don't know when it's time to leave. Verse 63 is curious...and of all places - Jerusalem! <b>Looks like a bad case of Jebusitis to me!</b> We aren't told any details regarding Judah's failed attempts to drive the Jebusites out. As a matter of fact, they stayed there for another three or so centuries. Another attempt is made in <a title="Judges 1 Summary" href="7-10.html#Nothing" title="II Samuel 24 Summary" target="_blank">II Samuel 24:18-25 (see notes)</a>.</p>
