7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. <br>
8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. <br>
9 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. <br>
10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. <br>

		<p>Jesus is closing out on a theme that emerged in <a title="Matthew 19 Summary" href="4-23.html#Reward" target="_blank">Matthew 19:16-30 (see notes)</a> regarding prominent positioning in the yet-future Kingdom of God. As a matter of fact, after Jesus gives the parable of the hired servants in this passage, he concludes with the same words as he restates his proposition of Matthew 19:30 here in Matthew 20:16 when he says, &quot;So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.&quot; </p>

                <p><font size="2">While the KJV consistently translates the Greek word, &quot;denarius&quot; as &quot;penny,&quot; one might wonder about the buying power of a denarius. We see in Matthew 20:1-16 that a denarius was a reasonable unskilled laborer's wage for one day's (12 hours) work. The denarius (silver) was the most commonly used coin in the first century. The other coins used during that period are related as follows:<br>
                  1 Aureus (gold) = 25 Denarii (plural for Denarius)<br>
                  1 Denarius = 4 Sestertii <br>
                  1 Denarius = 8 Dupondii <br>

                    1 Denarius = 64 Quadrans<br>

	    <p>In light of those two verses, it seems significant that Jesus had declared in Matthew 19:28, &quot;That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&quot; That, of course, is a reference to his twelve Apostles. Before the earthly ministry of Jesus, they had no reason to suspect that they would ever have a position of authority in the Messianic kingdom of the future. Contrariwise, the contemporary Jewish leaders had every reason to believe that they would be filling those positions of authority. With that in mind, verses 19:30 and 20:16 fit nicely with Jesus' message: The &quot;last&quot; (12 Apostles) shall rule in the Kingdom of God (Messianic kingdom) while the &quot;first&quot; (contemporary Jewish leaders) will come in &quot;last.&quot;		</p>
    <p>Just in case the reality of the-last-first-and-the-first-last scenario doesn't seem quite so fair, this parable addresses the fairness of laborers contracted during different portions of the work day, yet given the same amount of wages at the conclusion of the day. While it seems fair that the one who works the most should get the greater reward, <b>Jesus makes the point that when what has been promised is given, what more can one properly expect?</b> His point is that people tend to spend too much time comparing their dedication and accomplishments to others rather than focusing on the reward for service promised by the Lord.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, we get a little bit of monetary-exchange information here in this passage. Verse 2 tells us that these first laborers were willing to work all day for one penny. The Greek word for the KJV rendering of a &quot;penny&quot; is &quot;denarion&quot; - a Roman silver coin circulated during the first century. The KJV also sometimes translates &quot;denarion&quot; as &quot;pennyworth&quot; and sometimes &quot;pence.&quot; <b>Based upon its usage here in this parable, we can safely assume that a common laborer in the first century was willing to work for one denarion per 12-hour day.</b></p>

		<p>First, before the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth,<b> the Messiah must suffer as Isaiah </b>(<a title="Isaiah 53 Summary" href="12-12.html#Weeks" target="_blank">Daniel 9:24-27, see notes</a>)<b>.</b> Jesus outlines his imminent crucifixion to his disciples as they prepare to go to Jerusalem for the last Passover Feast. This Passover Feast will be different; Jesus will be crucified as our Passover lamb on the very day of the Feast. These verses put the discipleship comments of the preceding verses in clear focus. <b>If you are to follow Jesus as his disciple at this point, it will be to the death.</b></p>
	<p><b>Notice the specifics of Jesus' prophecy here regarding his crucifixion. </b>Not only did he prophesy that he would crucified (Greek: &quot;stauroo&quot; means executed on a cross), but that he would also be mocked, scourged, and spit upon. But then...resurrection in three days. The disciples couldn't say that Jesus didn't warn them. He gave them a full overview of what was in store just a few days out.</p>

		<p>So, <b>what do the disciples glean</b> from the comments that have just been heard indicating that the end is imminent? They clearly understand it's a Kingdom-of-God-on-earth proposition, and they think it is at hand. That's why the mother of James and John intercedes on their behalf as their agent, or should I say &quot;power broker.&quot; The fact that Mark doesn't mention that they utilized the services of their mother as their agent is incidental to the event. On more than one occasion in scripture the thoughts and intents of one are relayed by another. In this passage, their mother serves as their mouthpiece, but the desires for these leadership roles are their own. Of course she is a willing participant on their behalf; <b>she wants a prominent place in the leadership structure for her boys. What a mom!</b> We see in Matthew 20:22 that she made this request in their presence.</p>
	<p>To get the full impact of her request, we must go back to the comment made by Jesus at the beginning of this discussion in <a title="Matthew 19 Summary" href="4-23.html#Reward" target="_blank">Matthew 19:28 (see notes)</a>, &quot;That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&quot; So here's the picture: Jesus in the middle with six Apostles on his left and six Apostles on his right. Yeah...but who are the two seated on the two thrones right next to Jesus himself?</p>
		<p>And what about the reaction of the other Apostles to this request? Matthew states their attitude like this, &quot;they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.&quot; Mark wasn't actually there on that occasion, as was Matthew. Mark's information came from the other Apostles later on. He puts it more gently when he says of them, &quot;they began to be much displeased with James and John.&quot; Oh, well...any way you say it, the request wasn't at all well received with the other Apostles. Jesus uses this opportunity to teach a valuable lesson, &quot;A leader must first be a servant.&quot; Both Matthew and Mark convey the words of Jesus on this occasion as follows, &quot;...the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.&quot; As I said, &quot;A valid leader must first be a servant.&quot;</p>
		<p>Allow me to put a contemporary face on Jesus' reply in this passage. One of the problems, as I see it, in churches today is a struggle to acquire leadership positions in local churches. It causes friction and injects politics into the assembly of God's people. Jesus is establishing a clear precedent here when he declares that leadership positions should follow clear demonstrations of actual personal ministry. Here's the problem: People who don't minister to other Believers as the natural process of their daily routine are not going to suddenly become those ministers when they are officially given a leadership position. In other words, in churches today, many people hold formal leadership titles within the local church who aren't really ministers at all. This creates a political environment, but not a ministry environment.</p>

According to Mark's account, he was known as &quot;blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus.&quot; So, while two were healed, Mark and Luke only report on the one who was apparently well known, probably from activities later on as a disciple. Subsequently, these two blind men follow Jesus.</p>

4 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. <br>
5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. <br>
6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. <br>
7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. <br>
8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. <br>

<p><font size="3">Even though Zacchaeus is a Jew (verse 9), none of the Jews like him because he is a publican (tax collector). Tax collecting, we are told, was a contract job where contractors bid on the right to collect taxes from the Roman subjects of a particular region.<b>They paid the bid amount to the Roman government and then collected from the citizens an amount that provided a handsome return on their investment.</b> Luke identifies Zacchaeus as &quot;the chief&quot; among those tax collectors. In other words, he had people who worked under him in the business of tax collecting. Apparently the Roman government did not concern itself with how much the tax collector charged the subjects under his authority. <b>He could use the full force of Roman law to collect taxes.</b> By his own admission, he had thus extorted money from those over whom he had won the right to collect taxes. <b>When Jesus spots Zacchaeus in the tree, calls his name and invites himself over for dinner, Zacchaeus is overwhelmed with emotion at this acceptance by someone as prominent as Jesus.</b> Instantly he promises restitution to those he has wronged, and Jesus subsequently identifies Zacchaeus positively when he says, <b>&quot;This day is salvation come to this house.&quot;</b></font> Jesus obviously knew what was in his heart.</p>
<p><b>Those influential Jews are not happy.</b> As far as they are concerned, Zacchaeus is not redeemable; he's just a sinner. <b>Making any attempt to redeem him, in their minds, was strictly out of the question.</b> Moreover, any association with Zacchaeus by a &quot;righteous&quot; man would have been considered completely unacceptable. That attitude towards Zacchaeus by those who were offended sets up the next parable with verse 10, &quot;For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.&quot; <b>Zacchaeus was lost until Jesus found him.</b></p>

23 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? <br>

25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) <br>

		<p>This parable is introduced by Jesus to add perspective to the Zacchaeus incident when we read in verse 11, <b>&quot;And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.&quot;</b> So, what's the linkage here? It appears to me that as these people believe that Jesus is the Messiah, and that he is getting ready to establish the prophesied Kingdom on earth,<b> Jesus is calling into question the activities of the schooled Jewish leaders of that day (aka Sadducees, Pharisees and scribes).</b> They are looking for the return of the King and the Kingdom to Israel. </p>
		<p><b>Now, does this parable deal with the time between the first and second advent of Jesus, or does it deal with the time between the demise of Judah in 586 B.C. and this day when Jesus is preparing to ride into Jerusalem as the Messiah to restore Israel?</b> Based upon the timing of this parable with the story of Zacchaeus, <b>I believe Jesus is pointing out that the Jewish leaders of the day were making no attempt to win people to their version of righteousness.</b> Instead, they <b>flaunted their righteousness</b> before the common Jew as though they themselves were members of an exclusive club.<b> I believe this parable is an indictment against their selfish activities leading up to that day.</b> They had taken the gift entrusted to their care (knowledge of the Word) and refused to use it to bring people to God. Not only so,<b> they rejected Jesus who was about the business of making a positive impact on these common Jews.</b> I'm convinced that the <b>&quot;wicked servant&quot;</b> of verse 22 is intended to be a reference to those<b> Jewish leaders who did not invest their knowledge</b> of God in the common Jew. <b>Their self-righteous selfishness causes Jesus to reject them just as they had rejected Zacchaeus.</b></p>
	<p>Incidentally, Jesus uses the parable again with a few minor variations to characterize those &quot;wicked&quot; Jews during the Tribulation who do not anticipate the return of the Messiah in <a title="Matthew 25 Summary" href="5-21.html#Expand" target="_blank">Matthew 25:14-30 (see notes)</a>.</p>
	<p>There's another interesting aspect to this parable: It appears that Jesus may have used a real-life scenario upon which he based it. When Herod the Great died (approximately 4 B.C.) he had willed his reign to his son Archelaus (aka Herod Archelaus). At a previous time, he had willed the same reign to his son Antipas (aka Herod Antipas). After Archelaus assumed authority over the territory of Judea and surrounding areas, Josephus writes that he visciously put down a rebellion of the Pharisees, killing some 3,000 of them. As a result, he gained the reputation of being a very cruel leader. Because of the dispute regarding who should have assumed Herod the Great's position after his death (Archelaus or Antipas), Archelaus made a trip to Rome to gain confirmation from Caesar. Archelaus received this confirmation and was appointed ethnarch over the region until he was deposed in 6 A.D. because of his cruel treatment of the Jewish people who cried out against him to Rome.</p>
    <p>It is for this reason that many Bible scholars are convinced that the &quot;certain nobleman&quot; of verse 12 is based upon the real-life scenario of Archelaus.</p>
