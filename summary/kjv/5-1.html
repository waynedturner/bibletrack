<p><b>It is interesting to note here that John's gospel specifically identifies this event to have taken place six days before the passover.</b> Matthew and Mark do not specifically address the exact time of this Bethany experience. Though similar in circumstances, this event is different from the earlier occasion reported only by Luke in <a title="Luke 7 Summary" href="3-30.html#Martha" title="Luke 10 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 10:38-42 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p>It is interesting that Matthew and Mark only mention the ointment being poured upon the &quot;head&quot; of Jesus. John is the only one who reports the feet/hair ritual. Obviously she poured the ointment on his head and feet, but John gives more detail in his account. It is interesting to me, though perhaps not significant, that John, on the eve of Jesus' crucifixion, reports that Jesus washed the feet of his disciples and does not mention the communion service at all (<a href="5-25.html#Feet" title="John 13 Summary" target="_blank">John 13:4-20, see notes</a>). Both Matthew and Luke quote Jesus as commenting that Mary anointed his &quot;body&quot; for his burial. </p>
<p>Judas estimates the value of the ointment at 300 pence (aka &quot;penny&quot; which is translated from the Greek: denarion). Back in <a title="Matthew 20 Summary" href="5-26.html#Judas" target="_blank">see notes on Matthew 26:14-16; Mark 14:10-11; Luke 22:3-6</a>). Matthew and Mark report that other disciples, in addition to Judas, were unhappy about this waste of ointment also.</p>
<p><b>All three Gospel accounts quote Jesus as having said that this anointing was in preparation for his burial.</b> So, just how much did the Jewish leadership care about the truth? I think it is obvious when you read their reaction in John 12:10-11 &quot;But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.&quot; <b>They conspired to have Lazarus put to death simply to destroy the evidence of his resurrection.</b> When Jesus told them that they were of their father the devil back in <a title="John 8 Summary" href="3-26.html#Many" target="_blank">John 8:44 (see notes)</a>, you must admit that these were, indeed, evil men; yet, they were considered to be the most religious men of their day.</p>
		<p>By the way, going through life with a a name like &quot;Simon the leper&quot; has to be tough. Apparently he had been cured of leprosy, and the name just stuck. There's only one thing that I can think of that would be worse. Since Judas Iscariot was Simon's son (John 12:4), he would later be known as Simon, father of Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Jesus.</p>
		<p>Incidentally, if this story looks familiar, perhaps it is because a similar event took place earlier in Jesus' ministry, recorded in <a href="2-10.html#Pharisee" title="Luke 7 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 7:36-50 (see notes)</a>. In that passage, the woman is not identified and the timeframe is one to two years earlier.</p>

		<p>Now here's the really exciting part: This entry was prophesied in <a title="Zechariah 9 Summary" href="4-19.html#Lazarus" target="_blank">John 11:1-17, see notes</a>).</p>
		<p>Make no mistake about it; the people were acknowledging Jesus as the Messiah while Jesus rode into Jerusalem as royalty - even spreading branches and garments in his way to make a clean path for royalty. Furthermore, thousands of visiting Jews were there that day in anticipation of celebrating the Passover in Jerusalem. <b>Jesus had been preaching about the Kingdom of God through his entire ministry. That Kingdom of God was the message of the Messianic rule prophesied by the Old Testament prophets.</b> </p>
		<p>In Luke's account (Luke 19:39) we see that the Pharisees call upon Jesus to rebuke these people who are welcoming him into Jerusalem as the Messiah. Of course Jesus does no such thing, but perhaps uses a few words from <a title="Habakkuk 2 Summary" href="11-6.html#Woe" target="_blank">Habakkuk 2:11 (see notes)</a> instead, likely alluding to the fact that just as the stones could cry out regarding Babylonian atrocities, so could these stones cry out regarding the true identity of Jesus Christ as the Messiah. Incidentally, their reference to Jesus as &quot;master&quot; in verse 39 comes from the Greek word, &quot;didaskalos.&quot; It's the word used to identify a rabbi or master teacher. Thus the command from the Pharisees here is literally, &quot;Teacher! Rebuke your pupils!&quot;<br>
