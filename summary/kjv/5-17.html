<p><font size="3">I will say that good people disagree on the timing of the rapture of the church with respect to when, exactly, Believers will disappear from this earth in relation to this seven-year tribulation period. Every serious student of prophecy is typically able to make a strong case (at least in his own mind) as to why he holds his particular view. Volumes have been written in defense of each of these positions. Having studied those positions over the years,<b> I remain convinced that the position espousing that Jesus will receive Believers into Heaven at the beginning of the seven-year period </b>(<a title="I Thessalonians 4 Summary" href="9-10.html#Mystery" target="_blank">I Corinthians 15:51-53, see notes</a>)<b> and finally return to earth to stay at the end of that period is the most explicable view.</b></font></p>

		<p>As stated above, some of these indicators may precede the actual seven-year tribulation, but certainly characterize those first 3 1/2 years. So to be clear, Jesus' characterization of this period is sequential - making <font size="3">Matthew 24:4-14, Mark 13:5-13 and Luke 21:8-19</font> a picture of life during the tribulation leading up to the midpoint of the seven-year period. The exact middle of the tribulation appears in <font size="3">Matthew 24:15, Mark 13:14 and Luke 21:20</font> (<a href="#Antichrist">see below</a>). </p>
		<p>Thus, the seven-year tribulation is divided up into two distinct periods in prophetic scripture - the first 3 1/2 years and the last 3 1/2 years. The events prophesied by Jesus to take place in the first half are tumultuous, but are mild by comparison to those which are prophesied for the second half.<b> The beginning of the second half is marked by the man students of prophecy generally refer to as the Antichrist</b> (<a href="#Antichrist">see below</a>)<b> moving into the rebuilt Temple and demanding that he be worshipped as God.</b> Since that event is not marked in these passages until Matthew 24:15, Mark 13:14 and Luke 21:20 (<a href="#Antichrist">see below</a>), it is logical to assume that all of the events prior to these milestone verses take place either in the first half of the tribulation or perhaps some of them even before the rapture of the church altogether. <b>All this passage tells us is that they take place prior to the second half of the tribulation period.</b></p>
	<p><b>Here's what Jesus says will characterize this period, the first half of the seven-year tribulation:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>False christs (messiahs)
			<li>An unusually excessive number of wars
			<li>Unusual occurrences of natural phenomena like famine, pestilence and earthquakes
			<li>Increased persecution of the righteous
			<li>An increase in the number of false prophets
			<li>The preaching of the Kingdom message in the world (i.e. the rule of the Messiah over the earth from the millennium forward)		</ul>
		<p>As I indicated, <b>some of these events may take place prior to the rapture of the church, but not necessarily</b>. What these passages tell us for certain is that <b>these will be the conditions that will exist during the first half of the tribulation.</b></p>
		<p><b>Matthew 24:13 has been frequently misused by those looking for ammunition in their attempt to prove that one may lose one's salvation.</b> One's salvation may not be lost. The notion that it can be lost flies in the face of the whole unconditional-covenant theology clearly outlined in both the Old Testament and New Testament. Salvation is an unconditional covenant that God makes with each Believer at the time when he trusts Jesus Christ as his personal savior. That covenant cannot be broken; from that time forward, God deals with Believers as his children. For more information on this special relationship between God and the Believer, <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Trial_vs_chastisement.html" title="Trial versus Chastisement" target="_blank">see the article entitled &quot;Trial versus Chastisement&quot; by clicking here.</a></p>
		<p>Now, let's explain Matthew 24:13, &quot;But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.&quot; First of all, understand that this is a tribulation-period verse - spoken immediately before Jesus explains the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; which we know takes place at the half-way point of the tribulation, seen in Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14 (<a href="12-23.html#Facts" target="_blank">Revelation 14:1-5 (see notes)</a> for the purpose of evangelizing the world. In Luke's parallel to this passage in verse 21:18, we see that Jesus makes it clear that he's talking about the physical salvation (i.e. deliverance from physical death) of these 144,000 Jewish witnesses when he says, &quot;But there shall not an hair of your head perish.&quot; So, you see, this verse has nothing whatsoever to do with spiritual salvation during the present dispensation of grace. To misuse it as such is to do a disservice to scriptural context.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the clearest milestone in these passages is the appearance of the &quot;abomination of desolation.&quot; Matthew and Mark are even careful to specify that this event equates to Daniel 9:27, a prophetic passage of scripture that positively identifies the individual commonly referred to as the &quot;Antichrist&quot; (aka <a title="Revelation 13 Summary" href="10-24.html#Tribulation" target="_blank">II Thessalonians 2 (see notes)</a> gives us a detailed account of his activities in that regard at this time.</p>
	<p>Now, notice these verses (Matthew 24:16-20; Mark 14:13-18; Luke 21:21-24) where immediately following the tribulation midpoint of the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; described in the preceding paragraph, the remnant of the righteous in Jerusalem are told to &quot;flee&quot; into the wilderness. Many prophecy teachers feel strongly that the place to which they will flee is a place called &quot;Bozrah&quot; found in <a title="Micah 2 Summary" href="9-17.html#Messianic" target="_blank">Micah 2:12 (see notes)</a>. That's located in ancient Edom (modern-day Jordan), east of the Dead Sea in the mountainous region there. That position has great scriptural merit and should be considered by serious students of prophecy as a likely scenario.</p>
