	<p>This is a very sobering passage of scripture, all taking place the night leading up to the crucifixion. Matthew and Mark point out that Jesus' words regarding denial were directed toward all the disciples, but Luke and John just mention Peter's anticipated denial. Jesus quotes the prophet Zechariah (<a title="Zechariah 13 Summary" href="12-20.html#Shepherd" target="_blank">Zechariah 13:7, see notes</a>) to indicate that even the denial of the Messiah by his own followers was a fact of Old Testament prophecy. However, Peter is very adamant that, though all the other disciples may deny Jesus, he absolutely, positively would not - to the death. Jesus assures Peter that even he will deny him. However, in Luke 22:32 Jesus expresses confidence in Peter after the denial when he says, &quot;But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.&quot; The word &quot;converted&quot; there is a translation of the Greek word &quot;epistrepho,&quot; which means &quot;to return to a point or area where one has been before.&quot; In other words, while Peter will deny Jesus, he will return to his place among the disciples where he will strengthen and feed them.</p>
	<p><b>It should be noted that ultimately all Jesus' disciples would deny him.</b> As it happens, Peter's denial is more prominently displayed in the Gospel accounts, but actually, no one stood with Jesus at his trial. <a title="Mark 14 Summary" href="6-6.html#Ear" target="_blank">Mark 14:50 (see notes)</a> says, &quot;And they all forsook him, and fled.&quot;</p>

		<p>Jesus refers to the sending of the seventy disciples to preach the Kingdom message back in <a title="Luke 10 Summary" href="10-7.html#Isaiah" target="_blank">Isaiah 53 (see notes)</a> prophesies the crucifixion of the Messiah. Jesus quotes from Isaiah 53:12 in verse 37, &quot;And he was reckoned among the transgressors:&quot; Jesus is clearly preparing his disciples for his capture and crucifixion.</p>
	<p>With that being said, it is still, admittedly, difficult to account for every aspect of this conversation between Jesus and his disciples, especially the &quot;It is enough&quot; of verse 38. Some have suggested that these words were intended by Jesus to put a stop to a conversation which the disciples did not seem to be properly comprehending. Others have suggested that the phrase was intended to indicate that two swords are sufficient. &quot;Sufficient for what?&quot; you might ask. It is felt by some that the &quot;reckoned among the transgressors&quot; of Isaiah 53:12 was fulfilled in that two swords were on hand in the garden at the capture of Jesus, thus making them transgressors. Conjecture is simply all we have on this one.</p>

		<p>It's obvious at the beginning of John 14 that the disciples are on a different thinking track than Jesus. Their questions and comments indicate that they are thinking about an earthly kingdom while Jesus is NOW talking about a spiritual kingdom. As Jesus had preached to the Jewish masses for the three-plus years previous to this time, he had talked frequently about the earthly Messianic kingdom, but not here. The emphasis here has changed so as to equip them for the immediate future. </p>
		<p>Jesus begins by talking about the house prepared for them in Heaven in verses 1-4. Verse 5 demonstrates that this talk of Heaven rather than an earthly rule was confusing to Thomas; he indicates that he does not quite understand when he says, &quot;Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?&quot; <b>Verse 6 is your apologetics verse for proclaiming your position in Christ, &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;</b> There's no need to argue or explain; just quote John 14:6. Someone may reply to you, &quot;Don't you think that all religions are about the same if you're sincere?&quot; Don't argue; just, once again, quote John 14:6. It explains itself, and these are the very words of Jesus. Someone may come back to you with a question like this, &quot;Do you mean to tell me that everyone who doesn't believe in Jesus is going to Hell?&quot; Don't argue; just quote, once again, John 14:6. That verse says it all.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, the Greek word for &quot;mansion&quot; in verse 2 is &quot;mone.&quot; It's only used twice in the New Testament - here and verse 23 where it is translated &quot;abode.&quot; Quite literally, it simply means &quot;a place to stay.&quot; So, will our &quot;place to stay&quot; in Heaven be mansion-style nice? Need you ask?</p>
		<p>You will also notice that in verse 3 Jesus indicates that he, at first, must go and prepare a place for his disciples after which he will come and receive them. This is undoubtedly a reference to the rapture of the church discussed by Paul in <a title="I Thessalonians 4 Summary" href="5-21.html#Return" target="_blank">see notes on Matthew 24-25</a>)</p>

		<p><font size="3">I find Philip's request of verse 8 indicative of the state of mind of the disciples at the time. Keep in mind; <b>they have been thinking in terms of an earthly kingdom to be established right away. </b>Now they're being told that, instead, they will be introduced to the Father (God). Jesus mildly rebukes Philip for not already understanding the mission at hand and for not recognizing that when you see Jesus, you see God the Father. He then clearly explains that he is God. </font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Verses 12-14 have often been abused by well-meaning Believers who want to get things moving. Let's not beat around the bush on this one. <b>They had seen Jesus perform some awesome miracles</b> during the previous three-plus years of ministry. So...when Jesus says in verse 12, &quot;He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father,&quot; what do you think Jesus intends to convey? <b>I don't think we need to try to explain away this statement; we simply need to add the formula found in verses 13-14 - the &quot;in my name&quot; formula.</b> </font></p>
	<p><font size="3">It is common to append the words &quot;in my name&quot; to the end of our prayers. That appendage doesn't make it so. <b>&quot;In my name&quot; absolutely means &quot;under the authorization of.&quot;</b> Here's an example: When I was in college, I worked full-time in a bank and eventually became a lending officer/assistant branch manager. As such, I was authorized by the bank under very strict circumstances to sign cashier's checks - sometimes very large. I had NO authority whatsoever to indiscriminately write checks - ONLY when the bank's criteria for doing so was met, and I was authorized by the bank to do so. THAT'S WHAT &quot;IN MY NAME&quot; MEANS! </font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>I am convinced that God still performs miracles today through Believers who are in tune with what God is authorizing IN HIS NAME.</b> Here's the problem today: Many have been taught that there is something magical about the words &quot;in Jesus' name.&quot; Armed with that misunderstanding, they claim frivolous things &quot;in Jesus' name&quot; only to be disappointed at their success track record...or lack thereof. </font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><a title="I John 5 Summary" href="11-21.html#Trial" target="_blank">James 1:5 (see notes)</a>, &quot;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.&quot; You can pray with absolute assurance that you are praying &quot;according to his will&quot; when you first pray for wisdom. &quot;Wisdom&quot; in this context is knowing the will of God. After I have prayed for wisdom, I will be impressed by the Holy Spirit with a knowledge of the will of God; that's what wisdom is. Then, I can pray specifically and with confidence in exactly the way God has shown me to pray. <b>Only then can I legitimately pray &quot;in Jesus' name.&quot;</b></font></p>

		<p>Jesus then begins to introduce life after he is gone. By the power of the Holy Spirit they (and we) will be empowered by praying in his name. Jesus calls the Holy Spirit the &quot;Comforter&quot; in verse 16.<b> </b>The Greek word for &quot;comforter&quot; is &quot;parakletos&quot; - used only by Jesus in John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7 and once by John himself in <a title="I John 2 Summary" href="12-3.html#Mediator" target="_blank">I John 2:1 (see notes)</a> where it is translated &quot;advocate&quot; in the KJV. <b>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in Believers introduced by Jesus here is a foundational principle of life in Christ for all those who trust Jesus as their personal Savior.</b> That's where the power for the Christian to live a separated life comes from; without the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, salvation would be an empty proposition. However, with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, we have an ever-abiding partner who serves as our counselor and advocate...and he's always on the clock.</p>
	<p>To demonstrate that the disciples are still attempting to comprehend what seems like a change of plans, Judas (the good one - not Iscariot) asks a pointed question in verse 22. He obviously has been thinking in terms of the establishment of an earthly kingdom up to this point as well. He then asks, &quot;Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?&quot; That's in response to Jesus' guarantee of individual manifestation in verse 21. <b>Judas obviously was thinking, &quot;If Jesus is the Messiah over a world-wide kingdom, how is it that he will only be selectively manifested to certain individuals?&quot;</b> However, Jesus is now talking about the very process of individual salvation and not an earthly kingdom. Moreover, Jesus introduces to them the clear understanding that the &quot;prince of this world&quot; (Satan) is coming.</p>
		<p>Who's going to put this whole thing into perspective? Jesus answers that question as well in verse 26, &quot;But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.&quot; The ministry of the Holy Spirit is to provide the direction of Jesus in every Believer. Life after salvation is differentiated and defined by the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
		<p>Jesus makes a reference to Satan himself in verse 30 when he says, &quot;for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.&quot; Paul puts this &quot;prince&quot; reference into perspective in <a title="Ephesians 2 Summary" href="5-13.html#Happen" target="_blank">John 12:31-33 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Now is the judgment of this world: <b>now shall the prince of this world be cast out</b>. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. This he said, signifying what death he should die.&quot;</p>
