    </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The history contained in I and II Chronicles spans a period from Adam all the way down to around 500 B.C. It is therefore obvious that the author (perhaps Ezra) intended to recap Jewish history in one</font><font size="3"> book for the sake of the exiles returning to Israel in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. When they returned back to their land after their forced retention in Babylon, they needed to know as much as possible about their roots. It appears that Chronicles (originally just one book) was written to that end. The first nine chapters of I Chronicles give a recap of genealogies. The presentation here is not dramatic or entertaining, but rather provides a concise record of Israel's history for the exiles. In the KJV, there are some spelling differences between here and other books of the Bible where certain of the names are referenced.</font></p>

		<p>I know it's not captivating reading (unless you love to read genealogies), but chapter 1 encompasses the significant people in the Book of Genesis. Up through verse 34 we have the ancestors of the 12 Tribes of Israel (aka Jacob) and his brother, Esau. The remainder of chapter 1 (verses 35-54) gives us the descendants of Esau's people who became the Edomites. At the beginning of chapter 2 we resume with Israel once again.</p>

<p><font size="3">Now the Chronicles account concentrates on the history that specifically concerns Israel in chapter 2, as the genealogies for the 12 Tribes of Israel are listed. We begin with King David's ancestry from Jacob's son, Judah, through David in verses 1-15. David is listed as the seventh son of Jesse in verse 15, but according to <a href="7-5.html#Happy" target="_blank">II Samuel 20:4-12 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p>For the balance of the chapter we follow some lines in which we're not particularly interested, but the returning exiles in the sixth and fifth centuries were. We pick David's lineage back up at the beginning of <a href="6-3.html" title="I Chronicles 3 Summary" target="_blank">chapter 3</a>.</p>
