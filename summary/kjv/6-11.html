<p>David is crowned King of Israel at Hebron where he rules over a portion of Israel for 7 1/2 years - not the whole thing (II Samuel 5:5). Actually, according to <a title="II Samuel 2 Summary" href="5-28.html#Kings" target="_blank">II Samuel 2 (see notes)</a>, it was just the Tribe of Judah that made him king initially. Saul's grandson Ishbosheth was appointed king over the rest. We get our bearings here from II Samuel 2:10, &quot;Ishbosheth Saul&#146;s son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.&quot; There's a lapse of 5 1/2 years here between the death of Ishbosheth (<a title="II Samuel 4 Summary" href="5-28.html#Ishbosheth" target="_blank">II Samuel 4:1-12, see notes</a>) until the Northern Tribes come to David to take him as their king as well. This action seems to be prompted by the anticipated capture of Jerusalem from the Jebusites. Notice that the Northern Tribes acknowledge that God had appointed David as king; so...what took them so long to come around?</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is David's third anointing as king. Samuel chose and anointed him in <a title="I Samuel 16 Summary" href="5-16.html#Call" target="_blank">I Samuel 16:13 (see notes)</a>. Judah accepted him as their king, and he was anointed in <a title="II Samuel 2 Summary" href="5-28.html#Kings" target="_blank">II Samuel 2:2 (see notes)</a>. Now, here we have David being anointed over all of Israel. Sometimes good things take awhile!</p>

		<p>The Jebusites live in Jerusalem and felt their city was invincible. II Samuel 5:8 seems to be the boast of the Jebusites that their city was so secure, it could be defended by lame and blind people. David says, &quot;Let's take it.&quot; Joab made a name for himself here and became David's go-to man by taking Jerusalem. So much for invincibility! It appears that perhaps Joab entered the city through their water supply (gutter, conduit, spout - II Samuel 5:8). Obviously the Jebusites were expecting an assault on the wall instead. Out with the Jebusites and in with the Jews. It became known as the City of David. The city was repaired and expanded under David.</p>
	<p><strong>This marks the end of Hebron being the de facto capital of Israel.</strong> David has his house built in Jerusalem, and it becomes the new capital, sometimes referred to as Zion. It should be noted, however, the Jebusites were not all driven from Jerusalem. Later (<a title="II Samuel 24 Summary" href="7-10.html#Nothing" target="_blank">II Samuel 24:18-25, see notes</a>), David buys the property for the new temple from Araunah, a Jebusite.</p>

	      11 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time. <br>
	      12 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties. <br>
	      13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. <br>
	      14 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance. <br>
	      15 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim. <br>
	      16 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines&rsquo; garrison was then at Bethlehem. <br>
	      17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate! <br>
	      18 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD, <br>
	      19 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest. <br>
	      20 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three. <br>
	      21 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three. <br>
	      22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day. <br>
	      23 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian&rsquo;s hand was a spear like a weaver&rsquo;s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian&rsquo;s hand, and slew him with his own spear. <br>
	      24 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties. <br>
	      25 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard. <br>

		<p>When you got a big job and need a good man to take care of it for you, who you gonna call? David had his group of mighty men. Ezra, here in I Chronicles, adds a few to the list of men also found in <a title="II Samuel 23 Summary" href="7-7.html#David" target="_blank">II Samuel 23:8-39 (see notes)</a>. An interesting episode is listed here regarding three of David's mighty men that fulfill his casual wish that he could have a drink of water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem. These three risk their lives to retrieve this water for David from behind Philistine enemy lines. Upon their return, David is overwhelmed with this act, but pours the water out as a drink offering before the Lord as though it were the drink-offering wine of <a title="Leviticus 23 Summary" href="3-9.html#Feasts" target="_blank">Leviticus 23:13 (see notes)</a>.</p>

    9 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, <br>
    10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, <br>
    11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, <br>
    12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, <br>
    13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh. <br>
    14 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand. <br>
    15 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west. <br>
    16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David. <br>
    17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it. <br>
    18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band. <br>
    19 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads. <br>
    20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh. <br>
    21 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host. <br>
    22 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God. <br>
  </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>Those fighting men who stood with David after the whole Kingdom of Israel was united</em></p>

  <p><font size="2">23 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD. <br>

    25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred. <br>
    26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. <br>
    27 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred; <br>
    28 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father&rsquo;s house twenty and two captains. <br>
    29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul. <br>
    30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers. <br>
    31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king. <br>
    32 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment. <br>
    33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart. <br>

    39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them. <br>
    40 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of those who rode with David prior to his rise over all Israel, the men in verses 1-7 are datable to the 16 months before Saul&#146;s death. Beginning with verse 23 we see the men who came to Hebron after the 7 1/2 years of reign there to turn the whole Kingdom of Israel over to David. Finally, in this chapter, if you're gonna be king, you need a really big army. Well, here's your army - a big ol' army.</p>

		<p>So...David went from his little army consisting of just 6,800 men from Judah to a massive army  of nearly 340,000 almost overnight just prior to taking Jerusalem from the Jebusites. Obviously the Northern Tribes had deviated from God's plan with the inclusion of Levites (Levi, Aaronites and Zadok) in their army. It should be noted that an army of 340,000+ was, and is, an overwhelming force in that region of the world.</p>
