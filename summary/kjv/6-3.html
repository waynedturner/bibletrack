	      3 The fifth, Shephatiah of Abital: the sixth, Ithream by Eglah his wife. <br>
	      4 These six were born unto him in Hebron; and there he reigned seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years. <br>
	      5 And these were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel: <br>

		<p><font size="3">This chapter begins with a listing of the sons of David - 19 altogether, not counting sons of his concubines. Six were born to him in Hebron followed by thirteen in Jerusalem - four by Bathsheba. Only one daughter, Tamar, is mentioned here because of that ugly incident in <a title="II Samuel 13 Summary" href="6-29.html#Ammon" target="_blank">II Samuel 13 (see notes)</a> concerning three of David's offspring, Amnon, Tamar and Absalom. It's also pointed out in verse 4 the combined length of David's reign - 7 1/2 years in Hebron and another 33 years in Jerusalem. The balance of the chapter lists the descendants of David. These extend all the way down to the end of the Old Testament record through the exile to the return afterward. You may find it interesting to compare verses 10-24 to the table of the Kings of Judah. <a title="Table of the Kings of Judah and Israel" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Kings.html" target="_blank">Click here to see the table in a separate window.</a> The last descendant of King David to serve on his throne as King of Judah is Zedekiah found in verse 16. When the exiles returned in the latter part of the sixth century (B.C.), it was Zerubbabel (verse 19) who led them. He held a prominent place in the community, though not as king, because of his Davidic ancestry. Following are listed some historical milestones for Israel which take place during this period of genealogical records listed here.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Here are Israel's significant historical milestones after King David within the period covered by these genealogical records:</b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reign of Solomon (verse 5) beginning just prior to David's death (<a title="I Kings 1 Summary" href="12-14.html#Home" target="_blank">Ezra 2, see notes</a>)		</ul>
		<p><b>None of the kings of Israel (Northern kingdom) are listed here. </b>While the Northern Kingdom did not have a family line of kings, Judah (the Southern Kingdom) always stuck with a descendant of David as their king. In these verses we see the kings of Judah all the way down to the return of the exiles in 535 B.C. and beyond.</p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>Descendants of Judah (I Chronicles 4:1-23)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 The sons of Judah; Pharez, Hezron, and Carmi, and Hur, and Shobal. <br>
	      2 And Reaiah the son of Shobal begat Jahath; and Jahath begat Ahumai, and Lahad. These are the families of the Zorathites. <br>
	      3 And these were of the father of Etam; Jezreel, and Ishma, and Idbash: and the name of their sister was Hazelelponi: <br>
	      4 And Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah. These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, the father of Bethlehem. <br>
	      5 And Ashur the father of Tekoa had two wives, Helah and Naarah. <br>
	      6 And Naarah bare him Ahuzam, and Hepher, and Temeni, and Haahashtari. These were the sons of Naarah. <br>
	      7 And the sons of Helah were, Zereth, and Jezoar, and Ethnan. <br>
	      8 And Coz begat Anub, and Zobebah, and the families of Aharhel the son of Harum. <br>
	      9 And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow. <br>
	      10 And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested. <br>
	      11 And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir, which was the father of Eshton. <br>
	      12 And Eshton begat Bethrapha, and Paseah, and Tehinnah the father of Irnahash. These are the men of Rechah. <br>
	      13 And the sons of Kenaz; Othniel, and Seraiah: and the sons of Othniel; Hathath. <br>
	      14 And Meonothai begat Ophrah: and Seraiah begat Joab, the father of the valley of Charashim; for they were craftsmen. <br>
	      15 And the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh; Iru, Elah, and Naam: and the sons of Elah, even Kenaz. <br>
	      16 And the sons of Jehaleleel; Ziph, and Ziphah, Tiria, and Asareel. <br>
	      17 And the sons of Ezra were, Jether, and Mered, and Epher, and Jalon: and she bare Miriam, and Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa. <br>
	      18 And his wife Jehudijah bare Jered the father of Gedor, and Heber the father of Socho, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah. And these are the sons of Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, which Mered took. <br>
	      19 And the sons of his wife Hodiah the sister of Naham, the father of Keilah the Garmite, and Eshtemoa the Maachathite. <br>
	      20 And the sons of Shimon were, Amnon, and Rinnah, Benhanan, and Tilon. And the sons of Ishi were, Zoheth, and Benzoheth. <br>

	      22 And Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubilehem. And these are ancient things. <br>
	      23 These were the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work. </font></p>

		<p><font size="3">This chapter resumes where <a title="I Chronicles 2 Summary" href="5-31.html" target="_blank">I Chronicles 2 (see notes)</a> left off, tracing several of the branches of the tribe of Judah down to the time of Israel&#146;s united kingdom. At this point, however, the record of Judah's descendants restricts itself to the royal line of David (introduced in 2:15) and carries it through five centuries, to about 500 B.C. Incidentally, i</font>n verses 9-11 we see Jabez (made famous by Bruce Wilkinson in his book entitled, &quot;The Prayer of Jabez&quot;) and his prayer. Here's a guy who had to wait over 3,000 years to make it big.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Simeon"></a>Descendants of Simeon (I Chronicles 4:24-43)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">24 The sons of Simeon were, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul: <br>
    25 Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, Mishma his son. <br>
    26 And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son, Shimei his son. <br>
    27 And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brethren had not many children, neither did all their family multiply, like to the children of Judah. <br>
    28 And they dwelt at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual, <br>
    29 And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad, <br>
    30 And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag, <br>
    31 And at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and at Bethbirei, and at Shaaraim. These were their cities unto the reign of David. <br>
    32 And their villages were, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and Ashan, five cities: <br>
    33 And all their villages that were round about the same cities, unto Baal. These were their habitations, and their genealogy. <br>
    34 And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah the son of Amaziah, <br>
    35 And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah, the son of Asiel, <br>
    36 And Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah, <br>
    37 And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah; <br>
    38 These mentioned by their names were princes in their families: and the house of their fathers increased greatly. <br>
    39 And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks. <br>
    40 And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of old. <br>
    41 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks. <br>
    42 And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. <br>
    43 And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, and dwelt there unto this day. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember? This was the tribe (Simeon) of Israel who occupied cities within the boundaries of the Tribe of Judah as their inheritance (<a title="Joshua 19 Summary" href="4-26.html#Tribes" target="_blank">Joshua 19:1-9, see notes</a>). We see in verses 42-43 that about 500 men from the Tribe of Simeon crossed the Jordan River from Judah and went over into Mount Seir. You will recall that this was the land where Esau's descendants settled, the Edomites. Apparently, the Amalekites had displaced at least some of these Edomites. So, in the days of King Hezekiah (715 to 686 B.C.), the Simeonites crossed the Jordan, defeated the pesky Amalekites, and set up a community there at Mount Seir.</p>
<p><a name="Reuben"></a><font size="4"><b>Descendants of Reuben (I Chronicles 5:1-10)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father&rsquo;s bed, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright. <br>
    2 For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph&rsquo;s:) <br>
    3 The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were, Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. <br>
    4 The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son, <br>
    5 Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son, <br>
    6 Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites. <br>
    7 And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah, <br>
    8 And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon: <br>
    9 And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead. <br>
    10 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east land of Gilead. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reuben was the oldest son of Jacob, but he did a bad thing with one of his father's wives (<a title="Genesis 35 Summary" href="2-8.html#Jacob" target="_blank">Genesis 48:20-22, see notes</a>) - a double portion you see.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Gog of verse 4 here is a descendant of Reuben and has no relationship whatsoever with the Gog of <a href="12-31.html#Millennium" title="Revelation 20 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 20:8 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Descendants of Gad (I Chronicles 5:11-22)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">11 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan unto Salchah: <br>
    12 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan. <br>
    13 And their brethren of the house of their fathers were, Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven. <br>
    14 These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz; <br>
    15 Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers. <br>
    16 And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders. <br>
    17 All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel. <br>
    18 The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war. <br>
    19 And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab. <br>
    20 And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him. <br>
    21 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand. <br>
    22 For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may recall that Reuben, Gad and half of Manasseh occupied land east of the Jordan river at their own request (<a title="Numbers 32 Summary" href="1-27.html#Ishmael" title="Genesis 25 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 25:12-18, see notes</a>).</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Descendants of Manasseh (I Chronicles 5:23-26)<br>
		</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">23 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon. <br>
    24 And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and heads of the house of their fathers. <br>
    25 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them. <br>
    26 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their turning away from God is mentioned here. The fall to the Assyrians of those three tribes (Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh) that settled east of the Jordan River is referenced here and coincides with the events of <a title="II Kings 15 Summary" href="9-9.html#Pekah" target="_blank">II Kings 15:27-31 (see notes)</a>.<br>
