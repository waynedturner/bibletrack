<p>You
  probably noticed; this Psalm is looooong - 176 verses. Most scholars
  believe this Psalm to have been written after the period of exile
  (after 535 B.C.). The psalm conveys the thought that the Word of God
  contains everything man needs to know. So, <b>what's with the Hebrew letters dividing up the verses throughout the chapter?</b> Psalm 119 is an <b>alphabetic acrostic Psalm.</b> It is divided into 22 sections of 8 verses each. <b>In
    the Hebrew, each verse starts with a word beginning with the letter of
    the Hebrew alphabet for that section...in alphabetical order.</b> For
  example, the first 8 verses begin with words that begin with the first
  Hebrew letter "aleph." From a strictly human perspective, this is quite
  an incredible piece of poetry, but then again, God has a really big
  vocabulary. Imagine writing groups of 8 verses beginning with a word whose first letter of the first word is the same, and sequentially going through the entire alphabet like that. Can you do 8 verses, each beginning with words that
  start with "q," "x," and "z?" But wait! There's more! <b>The whole Psalm deals with the different aspects of God's law</b> - the magnificence of the Word of God. So not only did the author strictly
  adhere to the acrostic style in the writing, but at the same time he
  made the whole Psalm rich with substantive statements about the Word of
  God. As I said; it's an incredible piece of work.&nbsp;<a title="Summary of Psalm 119:89-176" href="7-22.html" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>This Psalm contains a lot of one or two-line nuggets regarding God's truth. <b><br>
Here are a few that have been particularly meaningful to me:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Psalm 119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.<br>
				Psalm 119:11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. <br>
				<i><b>It is the power of the Word of God in us that keeps us from sin.</b></i>
			</li><li>Psalm 119:63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.<br>
				<b><i>Regard for God's word is a worthy test when making friends.</i></b>
			</li><li>Psalm 119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. <br>
				<b><i>Nothing seems to make us more receptive to God than a little adversity.</i></b></li></ul>

will notice that except for verses 1-3 and 115, the whole Psalm is
addressed to the Lord. The author uses a variety of terms for the law
or Word of God, with every verse except verses 90, 122 and 132
mentioning at least one of these: law&nbsp; (instruction or
revelation), testimonies, ways, precepts&nbsp; (or orders),
statutes&nbsp; (or decrees), commandments, judgments&nbsp; (or
ordinances), word, path, word&nbsp; (the last &#8220;word&#8221; meaning promise or
utterance, as in v. 11). <font color="#CC0000"><strong>When we look at verses 89-176, we'll analyze a
