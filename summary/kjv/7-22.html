      89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. <br>
      90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. <br>
      91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants. <br>
      92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction. <br>
      93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me. <br>
      94 I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts. <br>
      95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies. <br>
      96 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad. </font></p>
	  <p><font size="2"><em><strong>Each of the following Hebrew verses begin with the letter </strong></em><strong>MEM.</strong><br>
      97 O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. <br>
      98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me. <br>
      99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. <br>
      100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts. <br>
      101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. <br>
      102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me. <br>
      103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! <br>
      104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. </font></p>
	  <p><font size="2"><em><strong>Each of the following Hebrew verses begin with the letter </strong></em><strong>NUN.</strong><br>
      105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. <br>
      106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments. <br>
      107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word. <br>
      108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments. <br>
      109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law. <br>
      110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts. <br>
      111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart. <br>

      115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God. <br>
      116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. <br>
      117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually. <br>
      118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood. <br>
      119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies. <br>
      120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments. </font></p>

      123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness. <br>
      124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes. <br>
      125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies. <br>
      126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law. <br>

      131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments. <br>
      132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. <br>
      133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. <br>
      134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts. <br>
      135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes. <br>

			<li>law(s): From Hebrew &quot;<i>torah</i>&quot; and is used 25 times; meaning &quot;a body of prophetic teaching.&quot;

		</ul>
		<p>Verse 89 begins this reading with a strong promise regarding the permanence of God's Word, &quot;For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.&quot; While the world treats truth as something that is relative, the truth of God's Word never changes because it is settled in Heaven. <b>Who wants a moving target, anyway?</b> It's wonderful to know that our God in Heaven has given us a living book for direction as is stated in verse 105, &quot;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.&quot; That promise gives the Believer confidence in knowing exactly what God expects from us as it says in verse 165, &quot;Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.&quot; The Hebrew word for &quot;offend&quot; there means that God's Word keeps us from stumbling.</p>
	<p><b>Psalm 119 is a great chapter that instills confidence in the Book we, as Believers, carry as our guide to Christian living - the Bible.</b></p>
