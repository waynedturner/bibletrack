    <p><font size="4"><b>Transcribed by Hezekiah's scholars<br>
				</b></font>Notice Proverbs 25:1, &quot;These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the <b>men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</b>&quot; We find in these next five chapters of Proverbs sayings with a little different format than we saw in the earlier chapters. These sayings, according to the introduction, were collected by King Hezekiah's men (715-686); Hezekiah is found in <a title="II Kings 18 and II Chronicles 29 Summary" href="9-24.html#Top" target="_blank">II Kings 18-20 and II Chronicles 29-32 (see notes)</a>. So, according to verse 1 here, these proverbs in 25-29 were, indeed, written by Solomon, but not collected into book form until done so by Hezekiah's authority over 300 years later. Here, Solomon talks about reputation, integrity, wisdom and the fool.<font size="4"><b><br>

		  <p><font size="2">1 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. <br>
	      2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. <br>
	      3 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. <br>
	      4 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. <br>
	      5 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. <br>
	      6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: <br>
	      7 For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. <br>
	      8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. <br>
	      9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another: <br>
	      10 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. <br>
	      11 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. <br>
	      12 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. <br>
	      13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. <br>
	      14 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. <br>
	      15 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. <br>
	      16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. <br>
	      17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour&rsquo;s house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. <br>
	      18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. <br>
	      19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. <br>
	      20 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. <br>
	      21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: <br>
	      22 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. <br>
	      23 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. <br>
	      24 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. <br>
	      25 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. <br>
	      26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. <br>
	      27 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory. <br>
	      28 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls. </font></p>

		<p>In <a title="Luke 14:7-14 Summary" href="4-11.html#Big" target="_blank">Luke 14:7-14 (see notes)</a> Jesus reiterated the principle found right here in verses 6-7, &quot;Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.&quot;<br>

<p>Proverbs 25:<font size="3">9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:</font><br>
    <em>Don't criticize someone behind his back; do it face to face.</em><br>

			<i>Appropriate speech is a beautiful thing.<br>
			</i></p>
<p>Proverbs 25:17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour&#146;s house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. <br>
			<i>Ever overstay your welcome?<br>

			<i>Paul quoted this one in <a href="8-21.html#Positive" title="Romans 12 Summary" target="_blank">Romans 12:20 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.&quot; The intent seems to be that the extended kindness will cause the person to be ashamed.<br>

	    </font></b></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. <br>
	      2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. <br>
	      3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool&rsquo;s back. <br>
	      4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. <br>
	      5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. <br>
	      6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. <br>
	      7 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. <br>
	      8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. <br>
	      9 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools. <br>
	      10 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. <br>
	      11 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. <br>
	      12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him. <br>
	      13 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. <br>
	      14 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. <br>
	      15 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. <br>
	      16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. <br>
	      17 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. <br>
	      18 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, <br>
	      19 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? <br>
	      20 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. <br>
	      21 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. <br>
	      22 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. <br>
	      23 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. <br>
	      24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; <br>
	      25 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. <br>
	      26 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation. <br>
	      27 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. <br>
	      28 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. </font></p>
