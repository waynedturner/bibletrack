			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. <br>
    2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD. <br>
    3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God. <br>
    4 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers. <br>
    5 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city, <br>
    6 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment. <br>
    7 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts. <br>
    8 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem. <br>
    9 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. <br>
    10 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass. <br>
    11 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king&rsquo;s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a title="II Chronicles 18 Summary" href="8-28.html#Battle" target="_blank">II Chronicles 18:28-34 (see notes)</a>, we saw that Judah's King Jehoshaphat had a close brush with death in his attempt to help his buddy, the wicked King Ahab of Israel, fight the Syrians. When Jehoshaphat gets back from battle, his own prophet, Jehu, goes out to meet him with some bad news, &quot;You shouldn't help wicked people!&quot; <b>He lets Jehoshaphat know that God is not pleased and that he should expect some wrath from God because of his unsuccessful battle fling with Ahab. </b>However, God is pleased with Jehoshaphat in this respect: he had (KJV) &quot;taken away the groves&quot; (removed the wooden images to the goddess Asherah) from the land. God also commends Jehoshaphat for having &quot;prepared thine heart to seek God.&quot; </p>
<p><b>Jehoshaphat goes on a tear instituting some Godly reforms in Judah with which God is very pleased.  </b>These reforms included establishing godly judges, empowering the Levites, and setting up the High Priest, Amariah, over them. He also appoints a man named Zebadiah to oversee judgment regarding &quot;the king's matters.&quot; You will notice in verse 4 that Jehoshaphat's influence apparently reached up into the Northern Kingdom (Mount Ephraim) with regard to worship of the One True God.</p>
<p><a name="Warfare"></a><font size="4"><b>When conventional warfare just won't work (II Chronicles 20:1-23)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. <br>
    2 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi. <br>
    3 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. <br>
    4 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD. <br>
    5 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court, <br>
    6 And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee? <br>
    7 Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever? <br>
    8 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying, <br>
    9 If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help. <br>
    10 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not; <br>
    11 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. <br>
    12 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee. <br>
    13 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children. <br>
    14 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; <br>
    15 And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God&rsquo;s. <br>
    16 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel. <br>
    17 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you. <br>
    18 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with HIS FACE TO THE GROUND: AND ALL JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM FELL BEFORE THE LORD, worshipping the LORD. <br>
    19 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high. <br>
    20 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. <br>
    21 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever. <br>
    22 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten. <br>
    23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another. <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>A combined force of three armies are on their way to Jerusalem, the Moabites, Ammonites and Edomites. </b>What will Jehoshaphat do? <b>He gathers all of Judah together, and they have a prayer meeting accompanied by fasting; he leads in verses 6-12.</b> Verse 13 indicates the magnitude of this prayer gathering, &quot;And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.&quot; I'm amused by one of the points in Jehoshaphat's prayer found in verse 10 where he implies in his prayer, &quot;If you had let our forefathers destroy these people, we wouldn't be having this problem right now.&quot; That's a recall of God's instructions to Moses back in <a title="Deuteronomy 2 Summary" href="4-4.html#Recap" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 2:5 (see notes)</a> to not war against any of the three of these nations. Just at the conclusion of his big public prayer, Jahaziel, one of the Levites, gets a prophetic word from God and starts speaking in verses 14-17. <b>God tells them the battle is not theirs, but God's.</b> All they have to do is show up; God will do the rest. </p>
<p>The next day, Jehoshaphat rolls out his new battle plan before the people in verses 20-21; we're just going to organize a big praise-God session and let God defeat the enemy. Oh, one more thing - singers; <b>Jehoshaphat puts singers in front of his army.</b> Hey...singing in that choir wasn't for the faint of heart! Of course it all worked out; the invading armies get confused in their ambush attempts (wouldn't you, if you came up against an army led by the choir) and turn on each other, wiping themselves out without Judah's army lifting a hand...except for the choir, of course. So, the Ammonites and Moabites mistakenly end up attacking the Edomites (inhabitants of Mount Seir) until everyone is destroyed.</p>
<p><a name="Aftermath"></a><font size="4"><b>The aftermath (II Chronicles 20:24-30)</b></font><br>
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">24 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped. <br>
    25 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. <br>
    26 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day. <br>
    27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies. <br>
    28 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD. <br>
    29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel. <br>
    30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about. <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jehoshaphat stuck with God, and God rewarded him for it. At the conclusion of the battle, the entire enemy army - all the soldiers - were dead; no one escaped. When they started taking the spoil from the battle they had won without fighting, they couldn't even carry it all. </p>
<p><font size="4"><b>A summary of Jehoshaphat's reign (II Chronicles 20:31-37)</b></font><br>
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">31 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. <br>
    32 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD. <br>
    33 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers. <br>
    34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel. <br>
    35 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: <br>
    36 And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongeber. <br>
    37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jehoshaphat served God all his days. <b>However, he didn't continually purge Judah from those pagan altars called &quot;high places.&quot;</b> The people built them back; it was an uphill battle. Jehoshaphat dies, but not before he and the King of Israel (Ahaziah) go into a ship-building venture together. God is unhappy about this business with a wicked king; the ships wreck. <b>Jehoshaphat consulted God in battle, but not in his business venture into ship building.</b><br>

            2 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. <br>
            3 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn. <br>
            4 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel. <br>
            5 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. <br>
            6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD. <br>
            7 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever. <br>
            8 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king. <br>
            9 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots. <br>
            10 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. <br>
            11 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto. <br>
            12 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, <br>
            13 But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father&rsquo;s house, which were better than thyself: <br>
            14 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods: <br>
            15 And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day. <br>
            16 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: <br>
            17 And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king&rsquo;s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. <br>
            18 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. <br>
            19 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. <br>
            20 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings. </font></td>

            18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD. <br>
            19 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant&rsquo;s sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children. <br>
            20 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. <br>
            21 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents. <br>
            22 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. <br>

		<p>Jehoshaphat, like a good father, provides for his sons after his death. He gives them their own cities and makes them princes over those cities. <b>Jehoram, his firstborn son, becomes king.</b> So, Jehoram, now that you're king, what are you going to do? Reply? &quot;Kill all my brothers! What do you expect?&quot; Not only does he execute his brothers, but also some other &quot;princes&quot; (government officials). I guess it is not necessary to point out that Jehoram was a wicked King of Judah.</p>

King Jehoram of Judah reigned from 848-841; his life is detailed in II Kings 8:16-24; II Chronicles 21. The son of the good king of Judah, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram was married to Athaliah, the daughter of Israel's King Ahab and Jezebel. With a wife like that, of course he was very evil. King Jehoram of Israel reigned from 852-841 and is found in II Kings 3. He was the son of Ahab and Jezebel, and successor to his brother Ahaziah on the throne of Israel. So, Ahab and Jezebel had a son-in-law who was king over Judah and a son who was king over Israel. Everyone mentioned here was very evil.</font></p>

		<p><b>Jehoram was married to Ahab's daughter, Athaliah, daughter of Ahab and Jezebel and grand-daughter of Omri, 6th king of Israel. She shared the trait of wickedness and ruthlessness with her ancestors.</b> Jehoram reigned over Judah for 8 years (from age 32) and <b>was all wicked all the time. Elijah wrote him a letter - told him that God had passed judgment against him because of all his wicked deeds in Judah.</b> He would die a messy death with a disease of the bowels. If that's not bad enough, Jehoram gets invaded by the Philistines and the Arabians; they carry off nearly all of his family and all his riches before he dies in agony as a result of his bowel disease. <b>Nobody is sad to see him go after his 8 years of wicked reign. They didn't even bury him with the other kings.</b> </p>
	<p>One bright spot is found in this chapter, though. Notice verse 7, &quot;Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.&quot; <b>Despite his wickedness, Jehoram caught a break because of the covenant God made with David back in </b><a title="II Samuel 7 Summary" href="6-19.html#Temple" target="_blank"><b>II Samuel 7:12-16</b> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> We know that covenant as the Davidic Covenant. <a title="Davidic Covenant" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Davidic_Covenant.html" target="_blank">Click here for additional information about the Davidic Covenant.</a> As a result, Jehoahaz, his youngest son was somehow spared in the invasion.

		<p>One more thing, we see in verses 8-10 that the Edomites flexed their muscles during Jehoram's reign and appointed their own king.

      7 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. <br>
      8 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them. <br>

<p>II Kings 8:26 reports that Ahaziah was actually 22 years old when he began to reign. Given the fact that his father, Jehoram, was only 40 years old when he died, it is certain that Ahaziah was 22 years old when his reign began (as reported in II Kings 8:26); his mama was Athaliah and served as his counselor; she was wicked. Just like his father, Jehoram, <b>Ahaziah never did the right thing before God;</b> he was wicked too. <b>He becomes an ally with King Jehoram, the son of Ahab and King of Israel. </b>Maybe he was impressed that Jehoram had the same name as his own wicked father. They went to battle against Syria and lost. Israel's King Jehoram was seriously wounded. <b>When Ahaziah went to check on him, he was captured and executed by Jehu of Israel who was actually gunning for Israel's King Jehoram. Jehu just took care of two kings in one visit and thus became the king over Israel. <strong>For more information on his execution, <a href="9-4.html#Kings" title="II Kings 9 Summary" target="_blank">see the notes on II Kings 9:14-29</a>. </strong>So, Ahaziah's dead after reigning for just one year.</b></p>

<p>This is where the whole descendancy-from-David-thing gets messy. Remember Ahaziah's (who's now dead) wicked mama, Athaliah? She must have taken wickedness lessons from her mama, Jezebel. <b>After her son Ahaziah is executed by Jehu, she decides it's time Judah has a queen instead of a king. She locates and kills the royal family. At least she thinks she has executed all the possible heirs to the throne of Judah.</b> Remember, in Judah they were adamant about their king being a direct descendant of David. <b>Athaliah misses one though - little baby Joash who was hidden away by Ahaziah's half sister, Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram and  wife of Jehoiada (the priest).</b> Baby Joash was in hiding for six years while the wicked Athaliah reigned as queen over Judah. Ironic...isn't it. Athaliah's daddy was the wicked King of Israel, Ahab (now deceased), and here she is picking up the reign over Judah. </p>

<p>Let's agree on something: <b>Athaliah was a baaaaad woman. </b>After all, she was Ahab's daughter. Her son Ahaziah had been King of Judah, but he died. She had then sought out all the royal family (male descendants of David) and had them killed so she could become Queen of Judah. One problem...she missed one - baby Joash. <b>Jehoida, the high priest, had hidden the one-year-old son of Ahaziah named Joash</b> (sometimes called Jehoash) <b>in the temple for 6 years. </b>Athaliah thought she was home free until one day Jehoida makes his move. <b>He coordinates with the shift change of the priests coming on duty and going off duty at the temple along with the military leaders to declare Joash King of Judah at the ripe old age of 7.</b> The plan works; the good guys surround the 7-year-old and proclaim him King of Judah.
