		<p>Azariah (aka Uzziah) took over from his disgraced father, Amaziah, at the ripe old age of 16. He began as a good king - One True God worship. He equipped a large army of over 300,000 and used &quot;engines&quot; on the wall of the city - catapults that fired arrows and rocks at the approaching enemy. You will recall that Israel had attacked Jerusalem during Uzziah's father's reign and had broken down a large section of the Jerusalem wall (<a href="9-7.html#Amaziah" title="II Kings 14; II Chronicles 25 Summary" target="_blank">II Kings 14:13; II Chronicles 25:23 - see notes</a>). Azariah rebuilt the walls. <b>He fought and defended Judah against its enemy neighbors with great success</b> - so much so that Azariah was famous as a warrior king in his day. </p>
	<p>During his reign, he dominated the Philistines, building Jewish cities among them and keeping them in check. Even the Ammonites respected him - the first mention of them since King Jehoshaphat (of Judah) took them on and miraculously defeated them during his reign (873 to 848 B.C) back in <a href="8-30.html#Warfare" title="II Chronicles 20 Summary" target="_blank">II Chronicles 20:1-23 (see notes)</a>. A century or so later, they're obviously still at peace with Judah. Uzziah's reign was successful at keeping Judah's enemies at bay during his tenure.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, the Zechariah mentioned in verse 5 is not the Zechariah who is responsible for one of the Books of the Old Testament. Little is known about this man who preceded the one after whom the Book was named by almost 300 years.</p>

		<p>Well...it's hard to know the players without a program. Uzziah is a contracted form of the name of the King of Judah here, Azariah. He's called Azariah in II Kings 15. However, here we find an episode where the King of Judah (Azariah aka Uzziah) is confronted by the priest (Azariah). Therefore, let's refer to the King from henceforth as Uzziah and the priest as Azariah...as does the II Chronicles account itself. </p>
		<p>Uzziah had been so successful in battle that he just forgets his place. <b>He goes into the temple to burn incense - BIG PROBLEM! Only the priests do that.</b> Azariah, the priest, confronts him about this no-no. However, Azariah (the priest) was smart enough to take some reinforcements with him for this confrontation, 80 associate priests. <b>Uzziah becomes angry with Azariah,</b> right there in the temple. He's irate in that he would even be questioned; after all, he's the king. While Uzziah is angry, <b>God strikes him with leprosy on his forehead</b> - leprosy which he had for the rest of his life. Uzziah spends the rest of his days in the hospital while his son, Jotham, reigns in his place. While Uzziah reigned for 52 years, much of that time was as a leper. It is during the reign of Uzziah that Isaiah begins to prophesy.</p>
		<p><strong>Some archaeological information regarding Uzziah's burial is included in the Jewish Study Bible as follows:</strong></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <blockquote>
		    <blockquote>
		      <blockquote>
		        <blockquote>
		          <p>An inscribed Aramaic marble plaque from the Second Temple period, now in the Israel Museum, reads: &quot;Here were brought the bones of Uzziah, King of Judah. Don&rsquo;t open.&quot; The wording suggests that although buried in the City of David, he was buried separately from other kings perhaps because of the leprosy whose bones were not reburied during the Second Temple period. There is no knowledge about where the plaque was originally found.</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">8 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months. <br>
	      9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. <br>
	      10 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. <br>

<p><font size="3">How do you become King of Israel these days? Murder, murder, murder! This one is particularly gruesome, though. When Tiphsah (a lost city) declined to throw open their gates to let him come in and take over, he demonstrated his ruthlessness - cut open all their pregnant women after he conquered them. That's not all he did. He had only interests in remaining King of Israel - at any cost. He assessed a tax on the Israelites to pay off the King of Assyria in order to be allowed to stay on the throne - which he did for 10 years.</font> The King of Assyria is named as &quot;Pul&quot; in verse 19. That was the nickname of Tiglathpileser, seen down in verse 29.</p>
<p><font size="3">Incidentally, the kingship of Israel at this point is now in the hands of the sixth family. We'll call this the fifth dynasty since (unlike his predecessor, Shallum) Menahem did have a son (Pekahiah) who took over the throne after his death.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3">Son of Menahem; evil just like his Daddy and Jeroboam from the beginning; killed by his body guard, Pekah. It's hard to get good, dependable help when you're evil through and through. If you're counting, this is the end of the reign of the sixth family of kings in Israel and the fifth dynasty of two or more kings from one family line.</font></p>

				</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years. <br>
    28 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. <br>
    29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. <br>
    30 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. <br>
    31 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Now the kingship of Israel (Northern Kingdom) is in the hands of the seventh family since Jeroboam split off after the reign of Solomon. Pekah probably assassinated Pekahiah because he and a following in the Northern Kingdom objected to Pechahiah's ties with Assyria - especially since he was taxing the people to maintain it and stay on the throne. So the King of Assyria, Tiglathpileser, came after him and began to chisel into Pekah's kingdom until Hoshea killed him, but not until after a 20-year reign. Tiglathpileser carried some of the Northern-kingdom people into captivity, including the land of Naphtali during his reign. This marks the beginning of the Assyrian deportation.</font></p>
<p><strong>We get some extra-biblical perspective regarding this deportation from an entry found in the Jewish Study Bible:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>In his campaigns of 733&ndash;32 BCE, Tiglath&ndash;pileser conquered the same block of territories taken by Arameans from Israel in the days of Baasha (1 Kings 15:20) along with Transjordanian Gilead. His annals mention that he took 13,520 people to Assyria. This marks the beginning of the Diaspora of the ten northern tribes.</p>
        </blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Incidentally, we see in II Kings 15:37 that Pekah apparently at some point allied with Rezin, the king of Syria, to attack Judah. Pekah is opportunistic and ruthless - no dynasty for him; Hoshea, the last king the Northern Kingdom would have, assassinates Pekah and establishes himself as the eighth (and final) different family to rule over the Northern Kingdom of Israel.</font> It is during the reign of Hoshea that the Northern Kingdom (Israel) falls once and for all to the Assyrians in 722/721 B.C. This account is found in <a href="9-19.html#Hoshea" title="II Kings 17 Summary" target="_blank">II Kings 17 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p>The length of reign of Pekah is a little confusing. Perhaps his reign began in Gilead in 752 B.C., at the same approximate time as did the reign of Menahem in Samaria. Pekah is the last king before Hoshea, during whose reign Israel fell. Therefore, his reign appears to overlap that of Menahem and Pekahiah, but for the first 10 years or so was not over all of the Northern Kingdom - just the region around Gilead.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Jotham of Judah: good king (II Kings 15:32-38)</b></font><font size="3"><br>
				</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign. <br>
    33 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. <br>
    34 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. <br>
    35 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD. <br>
    36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <br>
    37 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah. <br>
    38 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Finally...we're back to Judah. Jotham served the one true God, but he also allowed the places of idol worship to remain. By the way, his Dad was Azariah, aka Uzziah. He worked on the temple a little - died after a 16-year reign. During his reign, Judah was attacked by Rezin, the King of Syria, and Pekah the King of the Israel. After his death, his son Ahaz took over as King of Judah. Incidentally, if you're keeping track, Judah is still working from the dynasty of kings led by King David of United Israel. While Israel (Northern Kingdom) went through eight different family lines on their throne before their demise, Judah remained with one, single Davidic dynasty until their fall in 586 B.C.</font> This single dynasty of Kings of Judah was in keeping with the <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Davidic_Covenant.html" title="The Davidic Covenant" target="_blank">Davidic Covenant (see notes)</a>.</p>
