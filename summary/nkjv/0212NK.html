				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 So the LORD said to Moses: &ldquo;See, I have made you as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet. <br />
2 You shall speak all that I command you. And Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh to send the children of Israel out of his land. <br />
3 And I will harden Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt. <br />
4 But Pharaoh will not heed you, so that I may lay My hand on Egypt and bring My armies and My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. <br />
5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them.&rdquo; <br />
6 &para; Then Moses and Aaron did so; just as the LORD commanded them, so they did. <br />
7 And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh. <br />
8 &para; Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, <br />
9 &ldquo;When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, &ldquo;Show a miracle for yourselves,&rsquo; then you shall say to Aaron, &lsquo;Take your rod and cast it before Pharaoh, and let it become a serpent.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />
10 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as the LORD commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. <br />
11 &para; But Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers; so the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. <br />
12 For every man threw down his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron&rsquo;s rod swallowed up their rods. <br />
13 And Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the LORD had said. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Let's get our bearings here. This discussion with God carries over from the end of <a title="Exodus 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=11#Hebrews" target="_blank">Exodus 6 (see notes)</a>. God is preparing Moses to make another appearance before Pharaoh, but pay close attention to what God says in verses 3 and 4, &quot;And <strong>I will harden Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart</strong>, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.  <strong>But Pharaoh will not heed you</strong>, so that I may lay My hand on Egypt and bring My armies and My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.&quot; So, let's see...Moses is to go to Pharaoh (again) and insist that he <b>let the people go on a journey into the wilderness for three days to make a sacrifice to God </b>(<a title="Exodus 3 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=9#Bush" target="_blank">Exodus 3:18, see notes</a>). Oh! By the way...<b>Pharaoh will say, &quot;no.&quot;</b> His first trip to Pharaoh was in <a title="Exodus 5 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=11#Pharaoh" target="_blank">Exodus 5:1 (see notes)</a>, and sure enough, Pharaoh said, &quot;No!&quot; Now, <b>here's that second trip</b>, but this time he uses the rod God gave him that turns into a serpent. Eighty-year-old Moses goes before Pharaoh with his older brother Aaron, but <b>Pharaoh's magicians duplicate the rod trick</b>; their rods turn to serpents also. Of course <b>Moses' rod serpent eats up all of their rod serpents.</b> However, it still wasn't impressive enough to Pharaoh for him to negotiate. Of course verse 13 says, &quot;<b>And Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the LORD had said.</b>&quot; God had already said that wouldn't do it because God hardened Pharaoh's heart. So, <b>I guess we're right on plan.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Now, you might be wondering what's the point. I mean...if God told Moses before he even went to see Pharaoh this time that Pharaoh would refuse his request, why go? Answer: it was an exercise - one that Moses, Pharaoh and the children of Israel needed as an important part of their preparation; all involved needed to see a series of acts of God over a period of time. The text doesn't tell us that God prepared Moses and Aaron for the magicians to duplicate their rod-to-serpent trick. That must have been a disappointing surprise. Then...the excitement of seeing your stick eat their sticks - it must have been exciting. And...when Pharaoh's magicians went back to the rod store (if there was one) to get replacements - that had to be a little embarrassing...I mean...explaining what happened to your rod.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">There's one more important point that should be noticed here in verse 1. According to <a title="Exodus 4 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=11#Moses" target="_blank">Exodus 4:16 (see notes)</a>, Moses was to be a god to Aaron; therefore, Aaron is here called the prophet of Moses i.e. the person who would announce to Pharaoh the revelations of Moses. Now God tells Moses, &quot;I have made you a god to Pharaoh.&quot; That means that God has promised divine authority and power over Pharaoh. Armed with that word from God, there is no reason for him to be afraid of the king of Egypt. Moses was a god to Aaron as the revealer of the divine will, and to Pharaoh as the executor of that will. Incidentally, verse 7 tells us that Moses was 80 years old and Aaron was 83 at this point in time.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="River"></a>Plague #1: The river turns to blood (Exodus 7:14-25)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">14 &para; So the LORD said to Moses: &ldquo;Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart is hard; he refuses to let the people go. <br />
15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning, when he goes out to the water, and you shall stand by the river&rsquo;s bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand. <br />
16 And you shall say to him, &ldquo;The LORD God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, &lsquo;Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness&rdquo;; but indeed, until now you would not hear! <br />
17 Thus says the LORD: &ldquo;By this you shall know that I am the LORD. Behold, I will strike the waters which are in the river with the rod that is in my hand, and they shall be turned to blood. <br />
18 And the fish that are in the river shall die, the river shall stink, and the Egyptians will loathe to drink the water of the river.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />
19 &para; Then the LORD spoke to Moses, &ldquo;Say to Aaron, &lsquo;Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, over their rivers, over their ponds, and over all their pools of water, that they may become blood. And there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in buckets of wood and pitchers of stone.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />
20 And Moses and Aaron did so, just as the LORD commanded. So he lifted up the rod and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants. And all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. <br />
21 The fish that were in the river died, the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river. So there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. <br />
22 &para; Then the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments; and Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the LORD had said. <br />
23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. Neither was his heart moved by this. <br />
24 So all the Egyptians dug all around the river for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the river. <br />
25 And seven days passed after the LORD had struck the river. <br />
  </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><font size="3">Here goes that <b>third trip before Pharaoh</b>, this time with a significantly <b>more convincing miracle - turning the Nile river to blood.</b> The Nile, along with the other fresh-water sources (verse 19) remain that way for seven days, and all the fish die. While Pharaoh's magicians duplicate the miracle to some degree, still the <b>Egyptians lost their water source</b> and had to get their water from the ground instead of the river for that period of time. Nonetheless, <b>this didn't move Pharaoh to action.</b> No surprise though; look at verse 22, &quot;...and <b>Pharaoh's heart was hardened,</b> neither did he hearken unto them; <b>as the LORD had said.</b>&quot; It is important to understand that, while the ultimate outcome will be a complete release of the Hebrews to leave Egypt permanently,<b> up to this point Moses is only asking for a week or so off from work so they can go out into the wilderness and sacrifice</b> to God. <b>Nothing will be revealed to Pharaoh about the big plan of leaving permanently until later.</b></font> But, of course, <b>Moses and Aaron have already been told by God that this first plague won't cause Pharaoh to comply.</b></p>
	<p>By the way, I wonder why the magicians chose to make more bloody water. Wouldn't the better trick have been to turn the water back to clear again? Hmmm...you don't suppose it was because THEY COULDN'T, do you?</p>

2 But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all your territory with frogs. <br />
3 So the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, into your bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your servants, on your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading bowls. <br />
4 And the frogs shall come up on you, on your people, and on all your servants.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />
5 &para; Then the LORD spoke to Moses, &ldquo;Say to Aaron, &lsquo;Stretch out your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />
6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. <br />
7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt. <br />
8 &para; Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, &ldquo;Entreat the LORD that He may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD.&rdquo; <br />

10 &para; So he said, &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Let it be according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God. <br />
11 And the frogs shall depart from you, from your houses, from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only.&rdquo; <br />
12 &para; Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried out to the LORD concerning the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh. <br />
13 So the LORD did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields. <br />
14 They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. <br />
15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not heed them, as the LORD had said. <br />

    </blockquote>
	<p><font size="3">Frogs are kinda cute. Two frogs are twice as cute. At what point do frogs stop being cute? Look at verses 3-4 and you tell me: &quot;So the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, into your bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your servants, on your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading bowls.  And the frogs shall come up on you, on your people, and on all your servants.&quot; <b>Wherever the line is between cute and disgusting, we're waaaaaay there!</b> Verse 7 is just plain ol' funny. Pharaoh's magicians get their opportunity to demonstrate to Pharaoh that this is just a party trick and no big deal. <b>So, what do they do? Do they create mongooses to eat the frogs? No! They bring in more frogs! </b>Pharaoh's gotta be rolling his eyes on this one. Pharaoh says (paraphrased) in verse 8, <b>&quot;Just get rid of the frogs and your people can have a few days off to go make their sacrifice to God!&quot;</b> So, does Moses cause the frogs to trail back off into the river? Naaaaa. They just die right there in the spot where they were last seen - <b>dead frogs everywhere!</b> There were so many dead frogs that the <b>land of Egypt stank.</b> But still, look at verse 15, &quot;But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, <strong>he hardened his heart</strong> and did not heed them, <strong>as the LORD had said.</strong>&quot; We're <b>still on plan. </b>Incidentally, do you suppose the lack of fresh water in the rivers' from plague #1 caused these frogs to seek fresh water elsewhere?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="4">Plague #3: A few gnats (aka lice) don't cause any harm, right? (Exodus 8:16-19)</font></b><br>

17 And they did so. For Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and it became lice on man and beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. <br />
18 &para; Now the magicians so worked with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. So there were lice on man and beast. <br />
19 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;This is the finger of God.&rdquo; But Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, just as the LORD had said. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many Bible scholars say the Hebrew word here (used only 5 times) is uncertain and could be gnats, sand fleas, or mosquitoes. Now here's where the abilities of these magicians start seeming a little suspicious. They could duplicate the rod-to-a-serpent trick; they could duplicate the water-to-blood; they could duplicate the frogs; but, <b>are you telling me that they couldn't duplicate a few lice/gnats?</b> That's right! These little ol' critters become the deal breaker for the magicians. Who wants more lice/gnats anyway? By the way, don't frogs eat gnats? Whoooops...the frogs are all dead! As a matter of fact, the magicians have some advice for Pharaoh after the gnats in verse 19, &quot;Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, 'This is the finger of God.' But Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, just as the LORD had said.&quot; But there it is again; God had hardened Pharaoh's heart.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Plague #4: Even one fly is irritating (Exodus 8:20-32)</b></font><br>

  <p><font size="2">20 &para; And the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes out to the water. Then say to him, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;Let My people go, that they may serve Me. <br />
21 Or else, if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand.<br />
22 And in that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there, in order that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the land. <br />
23 I will make a difference between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall be.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />
24 And the LORD did so. Thick swarms of flies came into the house of Pharaoh, into his servants&rsquo; houses, and into all the land of Egypt. The land was corrupted because of the swarms of flies.<br />
25 &para; Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, &ldquo;Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.&rdquo; <br />
26 &para; And Moses said, &ldquo;It is not right to do so, for we would be sacrificing the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God. If we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, then will they not stone us? <br />
27 We will go three days&rsquo; journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He will command us.&rdquo; <br />
28 &para; So Pharaoh said, &ldquo;I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Intercede for me.&rdquo; <br />
29 &para; Then Moses said, &ldquo;Indeed I am going out from you, and I will entreat the LORD, that the swarms of flies may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. But let Pharaoh not deal deceitfully anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.&rdquo; <br />
30 &para; So Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated the LORD. <br />
31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained. <br />
32 But Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also; neither would he let the people go. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Pharaoh doesn't like flies either...especially in these massive swarms all over Egypt, except Goshen where the Hebrews live. You don't suppose the flies were swarming over all the dead frogs, do you? Without even calling upon his magicians this time (What would be the point?), <b>Pharaoh's resolve begins to weaken;</b> he starts to negotiate with Moses. <b>Pharaoh offer #1: </b>Sacrifice to your God, but stay in Goshen to do it. <b>Moses' counter offer: &quot;No!&quot;</b> By the way, Moses points out that the Egyptians will find the Hebrew method of sacrificing very distasteful - better not do it in front of them. <b>Pharaoh offer #2:</b> Go sacrifice, but not three days' journey away from Egypt - somewhere closer than that; just ask your God, and see what he says. Moses agrees to ask God, but insists that <b>Pharaoh needs to keep his word and not cheat </b>on his offer. God causes the flies to go away, but verse 32 tells us that Pharaoh did cheat on his offer. <b>His heart was hardened.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Isn't it interesting that the proposed deal on the table between Moses and Pharaoh at this point is still a temporary release for the Hebrews to go make a sacrifice. We know the plan is much larger than that, but obviously Pharaoh does not.</b></font></p>

	<p><font size="3">It's interesting that Moses was talking about sacrificing cattle in the preceding verses and how distasteful Egyptians would find this practice.

Verse 7, &quot;... <b>But the heart of Pharaoh became hard, and he did not let the people go.</b>&quot; Now, don't lose sight of why Pharaoh's heart was hardened.

28 Entreat the LORD, that there may be no more mighty thundering and hail, for it is enough. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.&rdquo; <br />
29 &para; So Moses said to him, &ldquo;As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, that you may know that the earth is the LORD&rsquo;S. <br />
30 But as for you and your servants, I know that you will not yet fear the LORD God.&rdquo; <br />
31 &para; Now the flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the head and the flax was in bud. <br />
32 But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they are late crops. <br />
33 &para; So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to the LORD; then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth. <br />
34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more; and he hardened his heart, he and his servants. <br />
35 So the heart of Pharaoh was hard; neither would he let the children of Israel go, as the LORD had spoken by Moses. </font> </p>

<p>This one is big, really big. God sends<b> huge, heavy hail stones that kill everything outside,</b> but Moses gives a warning first. You will recall that the <b>cattle in the fields </b>in verses 1-7 have already died. They had better get the remaining cattle under shelter along with their people if they want to survive this hail. <b>This is the first plague that actually threatens human life. Obviously, the plagues have intensified.&nbsp; No hail in Goshen, </b>though, where the Hebrews lived. <b>Pharaoh does hate a hail storm;</b> he makes a precedent-setting statement in verse 27, <b>&quot;...I have sinned this time. The LORD is righteous, and my people and I are wicked.&quot;</b> Hey! Moses! Pleeeeaaaase make the hail storm stop! So, how does Moses respond to Pharaoh's words of repentance. He agrees to make the hail storm stop, but says in verse 30, &quot;But as for you and your servants, <b>I know that you will not yet fear the LORD God.&quot;</b> Sure enough, look at verses 34-35, &quot;And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more; and <b>he hardened his heart, </b>he and his servants.<b> So the heart of Pharaoh was hard; </b>neither would he let the children of Israel go,<b> as the LORD had spoken by Moses.&quot;</b><font size="3"> Well, no surprises here; <b>it's all working just the way God said it would.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>We do see something quite interesting in verse 16,</b> &quot;But indeed for this purpose I have raised you up, that I may show My power in you, and that My name may be declared in all the earth.&quot; In other words, Pharaoh had been raised up by God for this very special mission of being the poster boy of God's wrath. Why? It was so that &quot;my [God] name may be declared throughout all the earth.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Verses 31-32 contain some interesting seasonal information that directs us toward a time frame for this seventh plague. Following is an excerpt from the Old Testament commentary by Keil and Delitzsch regarding the agricultural season in which the seventh plague occurred:</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><font size="3">The barley is ripe about the end of February or beginning of March; the wheat, at the end of March or beginning of April. The flax is in flower at the end of January. In the neighbourhood of Alexandria, and therefore quite in the north of Egypt, the spelt is ripe at the end of April, and farther south it is probably somewhat earlier; for, according to other accounts, the wheat and spelt ripen at the same time (vid., Hengstenberg,  p. 119). Consequently the plague of hail occurred at the end of January, or at the latest in the first half of February; so that there were at least eight weeks between the seventh and tenth plagues. The hail must have smitten the half, therefore, of the most important field-produce, viz., the barley, which was a valuable article of food both for men, especially the poorer classes, and for cattle, and the flax, which was also a very important part of the produce of Egypt; whereas the spelt, of which the Egyptians preferred to make their bread (Herod.  2, 36, 77), and the wheat were still spared.</font></p>
