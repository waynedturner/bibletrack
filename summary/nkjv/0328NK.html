    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2">1 And it came to pass, after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying: <br />
2 &ldquo;Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel from twenty years old and above, by their fathers&rsquo; houses, all who are able to go to war in Israel.&rdquo; <br />
3 So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, saying: <br />
4 &ldquo;Take a census of the people from twenty years old and above, just as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt.&rdquo; <br />

Reuben's immediate neighbors on the south side were Simeon and Gad. <b>Their numbers were reduced by 45,020 (approximately 30%) over those 38 years.

6 of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites. <br />
7 These are the families of the Reubenites: those who were numbered of them were forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty. <br />
8 And the son of Pallu was Eliab. <br />
9 The sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram, representatives of the congregation, who contended against Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah, when they contended against the LORD; <br />
10 and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up together with Korah when that company died, when the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men; and they became a sign. <br />
11 Nevertheless the children of Korah did not die. <br />
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Reuben's tribe took a hit in numbers between the first and second census. The reason is seen in verses 9-11; it was the rebellion that caused some massive deaths among the tribes on the south side of the tabernacle (<a title="Numbers 16 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=23#Democracy" target="_blank">Numbers 16, see notes</a>). Reuben's numbers diminished to 43,730 from 46,500 since the original census, a loss of 2,770.<br>

    <p><font size="3">Simeon's tribe was located on the south side of the tabernacle along with Reuben.

As a matter of fact, Simeon suffered the biggest loss in population, now only numbering 22,200 - down from 59,300, a loss of 37,100.<font size="2"><br>

    <p>The Levites were numbered from one month old upward - only males. <b>Their number in the 40th year according to verse 62 was 23,000.</b> They weren't numbered above because they were separated out and received no inheritance of land for their tribe. The Levites lived among the other twelve tribes upon arrival into Canaan.</p>
    <p>You will recall that when the Hebrews wanted to stone Moses and Aaron after the spies came back in <a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=21#People" target="_blank">Numbers 14 (see notes)</a>, God made a decree which kept them in the wilderness for another 38+ years. Remember his words in <b>Numbers 14:29-30, &quot;The carcasses of you who have complained against Me shall fall in this wilderness, all of you who were numbered, according to your entire number, from twenty years old and above.  Except for <font color="#FF0000">Caleb</font> the son of Jephunneh and <font color="#FF0000">Joshua</font> the son of Nun, you shall by no means enter the land which I swore I would make you dwell in.&quot;</b></p>
	<p>Now notice the comment made regarding this fortieth-year census in <b>Numbers 26:64-65, &quot;But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they numbered the children of Israel in the Wilderness of Sinai.  For the LORD had said of them, 'They shall surely die in the wilderness.' So there was not left a man of them, except <font color="#FF0000">Caleb</font> the son of Jephunneh and <font color="#FF0000">Joshua</font> the son of Nun.&quot;</b></p>
	<p>Here's an interesting aspect of this count. Who is now the High Priest succeeding Aaron and going on into Canaan with Israel? If you said <font color="#ee0000"><b>Eleazar</b></font>, you are correct. However, <b>Eleazar was serving as a priest under his father Aaron back before the spies were sent out</b>, so obviously he was an adult at that point in time, and if we follow the service age of the priests in <a title="Numbers 4 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=15#Levites" target="_blank">Numbers 4 (see notes)</a>, <b>he was at least 30 years old</b>. Yet, he did not die before reaching Canaan. <b>Therefore, one can confidently deduct that the Levites were exempt from the judgment on the adult men of </b><a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=21#People" target="_blank"><b>Numbers 14:29-30 (see notes)</b></a><b>. <i>Refer to the window to the right of this screen for a full development of the wilderness decree <a title="The Wilderness Decree" href="http://www.bibletrack.com/notes/resource/misc/Wilderness_death_decree.html" target="_blank">or click here to read it in a separate window.</a></i></b></p>

		  <p><font size="2">1 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. <br />
2 And they stood before Moses, before Eleazar the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, by the doorway of the tabernacle of meeting, saying: <br />
3 &ldquo;Our father died in the wilderness; but he was not in the company of those who gathered together against the LORD, in company with Korah, but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons. <br />
4 Why should the name of our father be removed from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father&rsquo;s brothers.&rdquo; <br />
5 &para; So Moses brought their case before the LORD. <br />
6 &para; And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying: <br />
7 &ldquo;The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right; you shall surely give them a possession of inheritance among their father&rsquo;s brothers, and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them. <br />
8 And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: &ldquo;If a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter. <br />
9 If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers. <br />
10 If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father&rsquo;s brothers. <br />
11 And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the relative closest to him in his family, and he shall possess it.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; And it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, just as the LORD commanded Moses. <br />

	<p><font size="3">The squeaky wheel gets the oil. These women (daughters of Zelophehad of the Tribe of Manasseh) approach Moses with their problem. Because their father had died in the wilderness since they left Egypt, current inheritance laws leave them with nothing when they arrive in Canaan. Hmmm...big Law revision is in view here; Moses consults God himself on the issue. Subsequently, God commands Moses to make some you-won't-be-left-out legislation to take care of the situation for them as well as others who may fall into that category. </font></p>

13 And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered. <br />
14 For in the Wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My command to hallow Me at the waters before their eyes.&rdquo; (These are the waters of Meribah, at Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin.) <br />
15 &para; Then Moses spoke to the LORD, saying: <br />
16 &ldquo;Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, <br />
17 who may go out before them and go in before them, who may lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of the LORD may not be like sheep which have no shepherd.&rdquo; <br />

19 set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and inaugurate him in their sight. <br />
20 And you shall give some of your authority to him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. <br />

	<p>That's right; Joshua gets the big job. Moses had gotten the word from God that, because of his fit of rage in <a title="Numbers 20 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=24#Years" target="_blank">Numbers 20:1&#150;13 (see notes)</a> regarding the water-from-the-rock incident, he won't be going on over into Canaan with his people. However, we do see the concept of eternal life in verse 13 when God tells Moses, &quot;you also shall be gathered to your people.&quot; They hold a swearing-in ceremony before the people for Joshua where Eleazar (the High Priest) will &quot;inaugurate him in their sight.&quot; <b>Meet your new leader: Joshua!</b></p>
	<p>Incidentally, Joshua had all the right credentials for the job. As a matter of fact, Joshua ascended the mountain with Moses in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=19#Mountain" title="Exodus 24 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 24:13 (see notes)</a> when God gave the plan for the tabernacle to Moses. Joshua was with Moses when they descended from the mountain in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=23#God" title="Exodus 32 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 32:17 (see notes)</a> to find that Aaron had constructed a golden calf. Since there are only two non-Levite men who were with Moses out of Egypt (Joshua and Caleb), it just makes sense that Joshua is God's man to lead Israel.</p>
