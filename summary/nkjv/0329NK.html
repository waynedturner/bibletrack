    <p><font size="4">As Israel is preparing themselves to enter into Canaan and possess the land at this point in Numbers, it is important for them to have an impeccable relationship with God.

<p><font size="4"><b>Daily Offerings (Numbers 28:1-8)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <br />
2 &ldquo;Command the children of Israel, and say to them, &lsquo;My offering, My food for My offerings made by fire as a sweet aroma to Me, you shall be careful to offer to Me at their appointed time.&rsquo; <br />
3 &para; &ldquo;And you shall say to them, &lsquo;This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs in their first year without blemish, day by day, as a regular burnt offering. <br />
4 The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, the other lamb you shall offer in the evening, <br />
5 and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering mixed with one-fourth of a hin of pressed oil. <br />
6 It is a regular burnt offering which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD. <br />
7 And its drink offering shall be one-fourth of a hin for each lamb; in a holy place you shall pour out the drink to the LORD as an offering. <br />
8 The other lamb you shall offer in the evening; as the morning grain offering and its drink offering, you shall offer it as an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD. <br />
          </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><b>Every morning and evening, a lamb had to be sacrificed.</b> This was a communal offering made on behalf of the people. It is a restatement of the same sacrifices specified in <a title="Exodus 29 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=21#Consecration" target="_blank">Exodus 29:38-43 (see notes)</a> on the occasion of the consecration of the newly-erected tabernacle. Verse 4 specifies, &quot;The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, the other lamb you shall offer in the evening.&quot;<b> That's two lambs a day.</b> &quot;Why?&quot; you say. Exodus 29:43 says, &quot;And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and <strong>the tabernacle shall be sanctified by My glory.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name="Sabbath"></a><font size="4"><b>Sabbath Offerings (Numbers 28:9-10) <br>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">9 &para; &ldquo;And on the Sabbath day two lambs in their first year, without blemish, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, with its drink offering&mdash; <br />
10 this is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone dwelling among the Israelites is required by this statute to observe the sabbath, according to <a title="Exodus 31 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=23#Sabbath" target="_blank">Exodus 31:12&#150;18</a><a title="Exodus 31 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=23#Sabbath" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a>. Again, this is a communal offering made on behalf of the people. It involved the sacrifice of <b>two more lambs on each regular sabbath day. </b>This additional offering on the sabbath is specified here for the first time. It is interesting to note that the sabbath day was not a day of corporate worship for the Hebrews, but rather a day of rest.</p>

<p><b>The inclusion of a new moon offering only appears in this chapter.</b> The new moon began a new month for Israel. This communal offering is placed on a par with other major festivals with its sacrifice of a larger number of valuable animals (two bulls, a ram and seven sheep) and the addition of a sacrificial goat as a sin offering. Incidentally, the ancient calendar was an observational calendar based upon the appearance of a new moon to indicate the first day of the successive month. If you looked out your tent window and saw this sacrifice taking place, the old month was gone and the new one had begun. <a title="Jewish Calendar" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Jewish_calendar.html" target="_blank">For more information on the observational calendar see the information box to the right or click here.</a></p>

<p><b>The Feast of Unleavened Bread is celebrated during the seven days after Passover. </b>We first saw it in <a title="Exodus 12 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=13#Passover" target="_blank">Exodus 12:14-20 (see notes)</a>. This festival <b>marked the beginning of the barley harvest</b> (March-April). Unleavened bread was made from the newly harvested grain without adding yeast and was eaten as the first sign of coming harvests that year. The first day of this seven-day festival and the seventh day were <b>no-work days</b>. On the first day, two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year were offered along with a goat. This communal offering falls on the heels of the individual Passover lamb slain by each family the previous day.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">This festival is also called the day of first fruits, celebrating the end of the barley harvest </font>and was also known as Pentecost. </b>It fell fifty days after the regular sabbath day of the week following Passover (always a Sunday). That 50 caused it to inherit the name &quot;Pentecost&quot; in the Greek language to indicate it's reference to the Passover. The Hebrew word for &quot;weeks&quot; here is the same word used by Daniel in referencing the weeks of years in <a title="Daniel 9 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=12#Weeks" target="_blank">Daniel 9:24-27 (see notes)</a>. Therefore, to put this into perspective, this day fell exactly 7 sevens or 49 days after the Feast of Firstfruits (both on a Sunday). So, to call it the Feast of Sevens rather than the Feast of Weeks gives us a better idea of how it got it's name. It gets a lot of attention in scripture (<a title="Exodus 23 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=19#Rest" target="_blank">Exodus 23:16, see notes</a>; <a title="Leviticus 23 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=9#Feasts" target="_blank">Leviticus 23:15-21, see notes</a>; <a title="Deuteronomy 16 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=10#Feasts" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 16:9-12, see notes</a>).

<p><font size="3">On the <b>tenth day of the seventh month</b> the Jews observed the Day of Atonement (aka Yom Kippur), when all sin was put away (<a title="Leviticus 16 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=7#Day" target="_blank">Leviticus 16:1-34, see notes</a>).

This was the only occasion in the year when the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, and the whole congregation fasts in verse 7 where they are told to &quot;afflict your souls.&quot; That phrase is used to indicate a fast in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=9#Fasting" title="Isaiah 58 Summary" target="_blank">Isaiah 58 (see notes)</a>. They were also to refrain from work on this day, as it was a <b>no-work day</b>. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Ark of the Covenant disappeared prior to Jerusalem's fall in 586 B.C. In Jesus' day, there was no mercy seat in the Holy of Holies of the Temple. We're told by extra-biblical sources that there was just a big rock in there. Today's Jews don't even have a temple. All that remains of this special day today (Yom Kippur) is the fasting; no sacrificing of animals is done. It is still observed by most practicing Jews, but quite differently from the pattern of observance specified here in scripture.<br>

One more thing about this festival,<b> it will be kept in perpetuity even after the millennium begins</b> as we see in <a title="Zechariah 14 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=20#Turmoil" target="_blank">Zechariah 14:16 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="2">1 Then Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, &ldquo;This is the thing which the LORD has commanded: <br />
2 If a man makes a vow to the LORD, or swears an oath to bind himself by some agreement, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth. <br />
3 &para; &ldquo;Or if a woman makes a vow to the LORD, and binds herself by some agreement while in her father&rsquo;s house in her youth, <br />
4 and her father hears her vow and the agreement by which she has bound herself, and her father holds his peace, then all her vows shall stand, and every agreement with which she has bound herself shall stand. <br />
5 But if her father overrules her on the day that he hears, then none of her vows nor her agreements by which she has bound herself shall stand; and the LORD will release her, because her father overruled her. <br />
6 &para; &ldquo;If indeed she takes a husband, while bound by her vows or by a rash utterance from her lips by which she bound herself, <br />
7 and her husband hears it, and makes no response to her on the day that he hears, then her vows shall stand, and her agreements by which she bound herself shall stand. <br />
8 But if her husband overrules her on the day that he hears it, he shall make void her vow which she took and what she uttered with her lips, by which she bound herself, and the LORD will release her. <br />
9 &para; &ldquo;Also any vow of a widow or a divorced woman, by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her. <br />
10 &para; &ldquo;If she vowed in her husband&rsquo;s house, or bound herself by an agreement with an oath, <br />
11 and her husband heard it, and made no response to her and did not overrule her, then all her vows shall stand, and every agreement by which she bound herself shall stand. <br />
12 But if her husband truly made them void on the day he heard them, then whatever proceeded from her lips concerning her vows or concerning the agreement binding her, it shall not stand; her husband has made them void, and the LORD will release her. <br />
13 Every vow and every binding oath to afflict her soul, her husband may confirm it, or her husband may make it void. <br />
14 Now if her husband makes no response whatever to her from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all the agreements that bind her; he confirms them, because he made no response to her on the day that he heard them.<br />
15 But if he does make them void after he has heard them, then he shall bear her guilt.&rdquo; <br />
16 &para; These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter in her youth in her father&rsquo;s house. </font> </p>

<p>We looked at the value of vows back in <a title="Vows Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=12#Vows" target="_blank">Leviticus 27 (see notes)</a>. Here in Numbers 30, we see some criteria regarding vows. <b>A vow given in Israel was a serious matter.</b> Note the declaration regarding a vow by a man in verse 2, &quot;...he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.&quot; We see the subordinate position of women in Israel in verse 3-16. If a woman under her father's care uttered a vow, her father could void that vow if done so that day. Likewise, the husband of a married woman could void a vow. Widows and divorced women must stand by their vows (verse 9). </p>
<p>We find a warning regarding vows in <a title="Deuteronomy 23 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=13#Laws" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 23:21-23 (see notes)</a>, &quot;<strong>When you make a vow to the LORD your God, you shall not delay to pay it</strong>; for the LORD your God will surely require it of you, and it would be sin to you.  But if you abstain from vowing, it shall not be sin to you.  That which has gone from your lips you shall keep and perform, for you voluntarily vowed to the LORD your God what you have promised with your mouth.&quot; Notice what Solomon said about these voluntary vows in Ecclesiastes 5:4-5, &quot;<strong>When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it</strong>; 	For He has no pleasure in fools. 	<strong>Pay what you have vowed&mdash;Better not to vow than to vow and not pay.</strong>&quot; </p>
<p><b>Samuel was Hannah's vow to God in <a title="I Samuel 1 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=05&dy=11" target="_blank">I Samuel 1</a></b><a title="I Samuel 1 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=05&dy=11#Hannah" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a> prior to her conception. She subsequently presented him to the High Priest for service to God. And <b>who can forget Jephthah's foolish, unscriptural vow</b> in <a title="Judges 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=05&dy=04#Jephthah" target="_blank">Judges 11 (see notes)?</a> You will notice that <b>offering a human as a burnt offering WAS NOT part of the regulations of </b><a title="Vows Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=12#Vows" target="_blank"><b>Leviticus 27</b> (see notes)</a><b>; it was clearly a violation of the Law of Moses.</b> While completely contrary to God's law, it does show us how seriously the Hebrews took their vows.</p>
<p>To accentuate this point on vows, consider the vow that Joshua was deceived into accepting with regard to the Gibeonites in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=22#Oath" title="Joshua 9 Summary" target="_blank">Joshua 9 (see notes)</a>. Centuries later, under King David's rule in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=7&dy=5#Gibeonites" title="I Samuel 21 Summary" target="_blank">I Samuel 21 (see notes)</a>, Israel experiences a drought from God because King Saul had disregarded the vow that Joshua had made regarding these Gibeonites. As I said, a vow is a very serious matter with God.</p>
