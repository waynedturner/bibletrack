    1 &para; 	Vindicate me, O LORD,<br>
For I have walked in my integrity.<br>
I have also trusted in the LORD;<br>
I shall not slip. <br>
2 	Examine me, O LORD, and prove me;<br>
Try my mind and my heart. <br>
3 	For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes,<br>
And I have walked in Your truth. <br>
4 	I have not sat with idolatrous mortals,<br>
Nor will I go in with hypocrites. <br>
5 	I have hated the assembly of evildoers,<br>
And will not sit with the wicked. <br>
6 	I will wash my hands in innocence;<br>
So I will go about Your altar, O LORD, <br>
7 	That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving,<br>
And tell of all Your wondrous works. <br>
8 	LORD, I have loved the habitation of Your house,<br>
And the place where Your glory dwells. <br>
9 	Do not gather my soul with sinners,<br>
Nor my life with bloodthirsty men, <br>
10 	In whose hands is a sinister scheme,<br>
And whose right hand is full of bribes. <br>
11 	But as for me, I will walk in my integrity;<br>
Redeem me and be merciful to me. <br>
12 	My foot stands in an even place;<br>
In the congregations I will bless the LORD.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, David casts himself on the Lord asking that He pay attention to his circumstances. He maintains that his troubles are undeserved; yet he is suffering. Sounds a little like Job, huh? He repeats before the Lord his innocence. David doesn't maintain that he is without sin; he simply insists that the intent of his heart is to do the will of God.</p>
<p><b>Here's how Psalm 26 is structured:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>David first seeks vindication from God regarding his integrity (verses 1-8)
			<li>David petitions God to deliver him from the fate of the wicked (verses 9-11)
			<li>David determines to praise the Lord for the answer (verse 12).

		    1 &para; 	I waited patiently for the LORD;<br>
And He inclined to me,<br>
And heard my cry. <br>
2 	He also brought me up out of a horrible pit,<br>
Out of the miry clay,<br>
And set my feet upon a rock,<br>
And established my steps. <br>
3 	He has put a new song in my mouth&mdash;<br>
Praise to our God;<br>
Many will see it and fear,<br>
And will trust in the LORD. <br>
4 	Blessed is that man who makes the LORD his trust,<br>
And does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. <br>
5 	Many, O LORD my God, are Your wonderful works<br>
Which You have done;<br>
And Your thoughts toward us<br>
Cannot be recounted to You in order;<br>
If I would declare and speak of them,<br>
They are more than can be numbered. <br>
6 	Sacrifice and offering You did not desire;<br>
My ears You have opened.<br>
Burnt offering and sin offering You did not require. <br>
7 	Then I said, &ldquo;Behold, I come;<br>
In the scroll of the book it is written of me. <br>
8 	I delight to do Your will, O my God,<br>
And Your law is within my heart.&rdquo; <br>
9 	I have proclaimed the good news of righteousness<br>
In the great assembly;<br>
Indeed, I do not restrain my lips,<br>
O LORD, You Yourself know. <br>
10 	I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart;<br>
I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation;<br>
I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth<br>
From the great assembly. <br>
11 	Do not withhold Your tender mercies from me, O LORD;<br>
Let Your lovingkindness and Your truth continually preserve me. <br>
12 	For innumerable evils have surrounded me;<br>
My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up;<br>
They are more than the hairs of my head;<br>
Therefore my heart fails me. <br>
13 	Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me;<br>
O LORD, make haste to help me! <br>
14 	Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusion<br>
Who seek to destroy my life;<br>
Let them be driven backward and brought to dishonor<br>
Who wish me evil. <br>
15 	Let them be confounded because of their shame,<br>
Who say to me, &ldquo;Aha, aha!&rdquo; <br>
16 	Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;<br>
Let such as love Your salvation say continually,<br>
&ldquo;The LORD be magnified!&rdquo; <br>
17 	But I am poor and needy;<br>
Yet the LORD thinks upon me.<br>
You are my help and my deliverer;<br>
Do not delay, O my God.</font></p>

	<p>David seems to be on top of the world in the first 11 verses. He's praising God for deliverance and provision. But then...what's up beginning with verse 12. Were the first 11 verses for the purpose of reminding God in prayer all that he had done for him in the past, and now it's time to do it again? It looks like adversaries are out to kill him, but he's depending on God for deliverance. Notice verse 7, &quot;Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me.&quot; Mosaic Law dictated that each king who ascended to Israel's throne was to copy for himself  the Law into his own book. Notice that provision in <a title="Deuteronomy 17 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=12#Rules" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 17:18 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Also it shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write for himself a copy of this law in a book, from the one before the priests, the Levites.&quot;</p>
	<p>By comparison, you will notice that verses 13-17 comprise the entire <a title="Psalm 70 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=6&dy=25#Delay" target="_blank">Psalm 70 (see notes)</a> with minor variations in wording.</p>

<p><font size="3">Written by David, the introduction to this Psalm says, &quot;To the Chief Musician. Set to 'Do Not Destroy.' A Michtam of David.&quot; The word &quot;Michtam&quot; is used in six Psalm titles, always belonging to David (Psalms 16, 56&#150;60). All six are psalms of lament and four of the headings have historical references to David&#146;s struggles with the Philistines (56), Saul (57, 59) and the Arameans (60).  </font></p>
<p><b>This Psalm may be outlined as follows:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>David indicts unrighteous judges (verses 1-5) 
			<li>David calls for their swift destruction (verses 6-9) 
			<li>After the destruction of unrighteous judges, the righteous can rejoice in God&#146;s justice (verses 10-11)
        </ul>

    </blockquote>
		<p>David's prayer here is for God to provide strength and longevity to his kingdom and himself. He speaks directly of himself in verse 6, &quot;You will prolong the king&rsquo;s life, His years as many generations.&quot; With the adversity in David's life - especially in his early years - who would have guessed that he'd die of old age? It just goes to show us:<b> It's not how hard you live, but for whom you live.</b> Then, after referring to himself in third person in verse 6, he adds his personal assurance of eternal life in verse 7 when he says, &quot;He shall abide before God forever. Oh, prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him!&quot;</p>

<p><font size="3">David wrote this one as well. The Jeduthun named in the introduction is called &#147;the king&#146;s seer&#148; in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=17#Passover" title="II Chronicles 35 Summary" target="_blank">II Chronicles 35:15 (see notes)</a>. </font>David wrote a song for him in which he maintains that man is unreliable as he expresses in verse 4, &quot;they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.&quot; However, God is strong and trustworthy as in verse 7, &quot;In God is my salvation and my glory; The rock of my strength, And my refuge, is in God.&quot; <b>You can't trust man, but you can trust God.</b></p>
<p>Incidentally, Paul may have been referencing verse 12 here when he says in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=13#Judgment" title="Romans 2 Summary" target="_blank">Romans 2:6 (see notes)</a>, &quot;who 'will render to each one according to his deeds.'&quot;</p>

<p>David calls upon God to protect him from his enemies. Here's David's desire in verse 2, &quot;Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, From the rebellion of the workers of iniquity.&quot; So...when you put your reliance on God, where does that leave you? Answer...verse 10, &quot;The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and trust in Him. And all the upright in heart shall glory.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Really, there are just two main thoughts in this Psalm:</strong></p>
<ul>
			<li>The plot against David by his enemies (verses 1-6)
			<li>The punishment by God of David's enemies (verses 7-10)<br>
			
		</ul>
