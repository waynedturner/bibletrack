5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth; for God blessed him. <br />
6 &para; Also to Shemaiah his son were sons born who governed their fathers&rsquo; houses, because they were men of great ability. <br />
7 The sons of Shemaiah were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers Elihu and Semachiah were able men. <br />
8 &para; All these were of the sons of Obed-edom, they and their sons and their brethren, able men with strength for the work: sixty-two of Obed-edom. <br />
9 &para; And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, eighteen able men. <br />
10 &para; Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the first (for though he was not the firstborn, his father made him the first), <br />
11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth; all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen. <br />
12 &para; Among these were the divisions of the gatekeepers, among the chief men, having duties just like their brethren, to serve in the house of the LORD. <br />
13 And they cast lots for each gate, the small as well as the great, according to their father&rsquo;s house. <br />
14 The lot for the East Gate fell to Shelemiah. Then they cast lots for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor, and his lot came out for the North Gate; <br />
15 to Obed-edom the South Gate, and to his sons the storehouse. <br />
16 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came out for the West Gate, with the Shallecheth Gate on the ascending highway&mdash;watchman opposite watchman. <br />
17 On the east were six Levites, on the north four each day, on the south four each day, and for the storehouse two by two. <br />
18 As for the Parbar on the west, there were four on the highway and two at the Parbar. <br />
19 These were the divisions of the gatekeepers among the sons of Korah and among the sons of Merari. <br />

<p><font size="3"><b>In I Chronicles 23-26 we see David's division of the Levites into specific duties - all 38,000 of the men. </b></font><a title="I Chronicles 23-25 Summary" target="_blank" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=7&amp;dy=13#Levites">Click here to see the notes on I Chronicles 23-25</a>.
  The last group of Levites described in this section of I Chronicles are
  the porters (aka gate keepers) - 4,000 of them (Korahites). Hey! It was a big
  temple, and they worked shifts as well. So, what were these guys
  responsible for, exactly? Well, the temple was a holy place just like
  the tabernacle which preceded it. Access was limited to those people
  and things that would not defile it. These men were charged with
  controlling that access to prevent the defiling of the temple.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>And who watches the money? (I Chronicles 26:20-28)<br>
</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">20 &para; Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God and over the treasuries of the dedicated things. <br />
21 The sons of Laadan, the descendants of the Gershonites of Laadan, heads of their fathers&rsquo; houses, of Laadan the Gershonite: Jehieli. <br />
22 The sons of Jehieli, Zetham and Joel his brother, were over the treasuries of the house of the LORD. <br />
23 Of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites: <br />
24 Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was overseer of the treasuries. <br />
25 And his brethren by Eliezer were Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son. <br />
26 &para; This Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasuries of the dedicated things which King David and the heads of fathers&rsquo; houses, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated. <br />
27 Some of the spoils won in battles they dedicated to maintain the house of the LORD. <br />
28 And all that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had dedicated, every dedicated thing, was under the hand of Shelomith and his brethren. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These
  Levites, serving as porters (gate keepers), included two major
  stewardships over treasuries - the one over the treasuries of the temple (verses
  20-22), with their offerings and valuable equipment, and the other over
  the treasuries of dedicated objects (verses 23-28). These objects included the spoils of war going all the way back to Samuel.<br>

31 Among the Hebronites, Jerijah was head of the Hebronites according to his genealogy of the fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought, and there were found among them capable men at Jazer of Gilead. <br />
32 And his brethren were two thousand seven hundred able men, heads of fathers&rsquo; houses, whom King David made officials over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God and the affairs of the king. <br />

<p><font size="4"><small>These 6,000 Levites served as scribes and judges assigned to

  collection of taxes and tithes. </small><b><br>

2 &para; Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel, and in his division were twenty-four thousand; <br />

<p>Each
  unit had 24,000 men of Israel serving for one month each year. That's a
  rotating army of 288,000 - on 1 month and off 11. Of the twelve
  generals, eight of them were from the Tribe of Judah, David's tribe.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>The section lists the officers presumably involved in the census David had commissioned Joab to
  do back in <a title="I Chronicles 21 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=7&amp;dy=10#Census" target="_blank">I Chronicles 21 (see notes)</a>.
  Twelve tribes are mentioned, though it is a very odd list; Gad and
  Asher are omitted and Aaron is added. Verses 23-24 specifically deal
  with that census issue by shedding a little more light on the issue -
  taking into consideration God's promise to Abraham back in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=1&dy=22#Seed" title="Genesis 15 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 15:5 (see notes)</a> and <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=1&dy=26#Abraham" title="Genesis 22 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 22:17 (see notes)</a>. </p>
<p><b>Look at the stipulations of these verses:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=1&dy=22#Seed" title="Genesis 15 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 15:5 (see notes)</a> Then He brought him outside and said, &ldquo;Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.&rdquo; And He said to him, &ldquo;So shall your descendants be.&rdquo;<br>
<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=1&dy=26#Abraham" title="Genesis 22 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 22:17 (see notes)</a> blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God's
promise to Abraham was that his seed would be so numerous that they
could not be numbered. Yet, David commissioned Joab to try it anyway,
though Joab stopped short of numbering the minor men. It would appear
that God was very displeased with David's attempt to number the
innumerable back in <a title="I Chronicles 21 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=7&amp;dy=10#Census" target="_blank">I Chronicles 21 (see notes)</a>.<br>

26 Ezri the son of Chelub was over those who did the work of the field for tilling the ground. <br />
27 And Shimei the Ramathite was over the vineyards, and Zabdi the Shiphmite was over the produce of the vineyards for the supply of wine. <br />
28 Baal-hanan the Gederite was over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowlands, and Joash was over the store of oil. <br />
29 And Shitrai the Sharonite was over the herds that fed in Sharon, and Shaphat the son of Adlai was over the herds that were in the valleys. <br />
30 Obil the Ishmaelite was over the camels, Jehdeiah the Meronothite was over the donkeys, <br />
31 and Jaziz the Hagrite was over the flocks. All these were the officials over King David&rsquo;s property. <br />
32 &para; Also Jehonathan, David&rsquo;s uncle, was a counselor, a wise man, and a scribe; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king&rsquo;s sons. <br />

<p><font size="4"><b><a name="David"></a>Old Man David explains how he became king (I Chronicles 28:1-8)<br>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Now David assembled at Jerusalem all the leaders of Israel: the officers of the tribes and the captains of the divisions who served the king, the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officials, the valiant men, and all the mighty men of valor. <br />
2 &para; Then King David rose to his feet and said, &ldquo;Hear me, my brethren and my people: I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made preparations to build it. <br />
3 But God said to me, &ldquo;You shall not build a house for My name, because you have been a man of war and have shed blood.&rsquo; <br />
4 However the LORD God of Israel chose me above all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for He has chosen Judah to be the ruler. And of the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father, He was pleased with me to make me king over all Israel. <br />
5 And of all my sons (for the LORD has given me many sons) He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. <br />
6 Now He said to me, &ldquo;It is your son Solomon who shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be My son, and I will be his Father. <br />
7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom forever, if he is steadfast to observe My commandments and My judgments, as it is this day.&rsquo; <br />
8 Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, be careful to seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave it as an inheritance for your children after you forever. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>David
  assembles the leaders of Israel for the purpose of handing the task
  of building the temple over to his son Solomon. David himself had
  wanted to build a temple for God, but God said "no."
  David explains why in verse 3 - too much a man of war. More explanation
  is given in <a title="I Chronicles 22 Summary" target="_blank" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=7&amp;dy=10#Solomon">I Chronicles 22:2-19 (see notes)</a>. David reviews
  the process of how he was selected by God to become the King of Israel,
  and makes it clear that God has selected Solomon his son to continue.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>David now turns to Solomon (I Chronicles 28:9-21)<br>
</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">9 &para; &ldquo;As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a loyal heart and with a willing mind; for the LORD searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever. <br />
10 Consider now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it.&rdquo; <br />
11 &para; Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the vestibule, its houses, its treasuries, its upper chambers, its inner chambers, and the place of the mercy seat; <br />
12 and the plans for all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, of all the chambers all around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries for the dedicated things; <br />
13 also for the division of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the articles of service in the house of the LORD. <br />
14 He gave gold by weight for things of gold, for all articles used in every kind of service; also silver for all articles of silver by weight, for all articles used in every kind of service; <br />
15 the weight for the lampstands of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight for each lampstand and its lamps; for the lampstands of silver by weight, for the lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand. <br />
16 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of the showbread, for each table, and silver for the tables of silver; <br />
17 also pure gold for the forks, the basins, the pitchers of pure gold, and the golden bowls&mdash;he gave gold by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls, silver by weight for every bowl; <br />
18 and refined gold by weight for the altar of incense, and for the construction of the chariot, that is, the gold cherubim that spread their wings and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the LORD. <br />
19 &ldquo;All this,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;the LORD made me understand in writing, by His hand upon me, all the works of these plans.&rdquo; <br />
20 &para; And David said to his son Solomon, &ldquo;Be strong and of good courage, and do it; do not fear nor be dismayed, for the LORD God&mdash;my God&mdash;will be with you.

21 Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and every willing craftsman will be with you for all manner of workmanship, for every kind of service; also the leaders and all the people will be completely at your command.&rdquo; <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>David
  gives his charge to Solomon right in front of all Israel for them to
  hear. Verses 9-10 serve to set the stage for Solomon's rule. With all
  of David's faults, he was chosen by God as "a man after his own heart"
  (<a title="I Samuel 13 Summary" target="_blank" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=5&amp;dy=15#Saul">I Samuel 13:14, see notes</a>). David knew how important it was as king
  to stay focused on the One True God. <strong>David presents to Solomon the
  plans for the temple which, according to verse 19, he had gotten by the
  hand of God himself.</strong> It included the design of the structure and all
  the furniture and utensils - everything.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Free will offerings for the temple (I Chronicles 29:1-9)<br>
</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Furthermore King David said to all the assembly: &ldquo;My son Solomon, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced; and the work is great, because the temple is not for man but for the LORD God. <br />
2 Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might: gold for things to be made of gold, silver for things of silver, bronze for things of bronze, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood, onyx stones, stones to be set, glistening stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble slabs in abundance. <br />
3 Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, my own special treasure of gold and silver: <br />
4 three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses; <br />
5 the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be done by the hands of craftsmen. Who then is willing to consecrate himself this day to the LORD?&rdquo; <br />
6 &para; Then the leaders of the fathers&rsquo; houses, leaders of the tribes of Israel, the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the king&rsquo;s work, offered willingly. <br />
7 They gave for the work of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. <br />
8 And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, into the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. <br />
9 Then the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a loyal heart they had offered willingly to the LORD; and King David also rejoiced greatly. <br />

<p>David
  donates to the temple project an immense amount of personal wealth.
  Then the leaders of Israel give a substantial free will offering for
  the building of the temple as well. So...how do you feel after giving
  your contribution for the work of the temple? I Chronicles 29:9, "Then the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a loyal heart they had offered willingly to the LORD; and King David also rejoiced greatly." Simply said, they rejoiced.</p>

That we should be able to offer so willingly as this?<br />
For all things come from You,<br />
And of Your own we have given You. <br />
15 	For we are aliens and pilgrims before You,<br />
As were all our fathers;<br />
Our days on earth are as a shadow,<br />
And without hope. <br />
16 &para; &ldquo;O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build You a house for Your holy name is from Your hand, and is all Your own. <br />
17 I know also, my God, that You test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things; and now with joy I have seen Your people, who are present here to offer willingly to You. <br />
18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and fix their heart toward You. <br />
19 And give my son Solomon a loyal heart to keep Your commandments and Your testimonies and Your statutes, to do all these things, and to build the temple for which I have made provision.&rdquo; <br />
20 &para; Then David said to all the assembly, &ldquo;Now bless the LORD your God.&rdquo; So all the assembly blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed their heads and prostrated themselves before the LORD and the king. <br />
21 &para; And they made sacrifices to the LORD and offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. <br />

<p>He
  thanks God for his greatness. He prays for Solomon to seek after God
  with his whole heart. Now...time for sacrifices. The next day they made
  3,000 sacrifices of animals of significant size. That would be an
  all-day job.</p>

  Zadok, the priest, quickly anointed Solomon as king in a private
  ceremony. That was the first anointing. This second anointing referred
  to in verse 22 here takes place publicly. It was not Ezra's purpose in
  writing the Book of Chronicles for the returning exiles to rehash this
  well-known political brawl that was already well documented in I Kings.</p>

<p>Well,
  it's over. After 40 years of successes...it's over - "seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem." Those 33 years were the highlight of Israel's national
  history. David possessed all the land that God had promised to Abraham.
  That was not the case with Saul before David, nor any of David's
  successors. <a title="Deuteronomy 11 Summary" target="_blank" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=4&amp;dy=9#Map">For complete details on God's promise to Abraham and the fulfillment under David, click here.</a> <br>

They labor in vain who build it;<br />
Unless the LORD guards the city,<br />
The watchman stays awake in vain. <br />
2 	It is vain for you to rise up early,<br />
To sit up late,<br />
To eat the bread of sorrows;<br />
For so He gives His beloved sleep. <br />
3 	Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD,<br />
The fruit of the womb is a reward. <br />
4 	Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,<br />
So are the children of one&rsquo;s youth. <br />
5 	Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them;<br />
They shall not be ashamed,<br />

<p><font size="3">Notice the introduction to this Psalm, "A Song of Ascents, of Solomon." Here's
  a Psalm that reads like a chapter from the Book of Proverbs. Based upon
  the subtitle, it seems likely that this may be one of the last Psalms
  written by David with his son Solomon in mind, although that is just
  conjecture; we don't know the circumstances for the writing of this
  one. As a matter of fact, there's not even agreement among scholars
  that David wrote this Psalm at all. The subtitle in the KJV says &quot;Song of Degrees&quot; rather than &quot;Song of Ascents as here in the NKJV. Here's the entry from Easton's Bible Dictionary regarding this introduction:</font></p>
<blockquote>
			<p><font size="3"><b>Song of Degrees:</b>
song of steps, a title given to each of these fifteen psalms, 120&#8211;134
inclusive. The probable origin of this name is the circumstance that
these psalms came to be sung by the people on the ascents or goings up
to Jerusalem to attend the three great festivals (Deut. 16:16). They
were well fitted for being sung by the way from their peculiar form,
and from the sentiments they express. &#8220;They are characterized by
brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora [i.e., repetition], and by their
epigrammatic style...More than half of them are cheerful, and all of
them hopeful.&#8221; They are sometimes called &#8220;Pilgrim Songs.&#8221; Four of them
were written by David, <b>one (127) by Solomon,</b> and the rest are anonymous.</font></p>

children are a blessing from God - lots of them. This Psalm covers
three areas of Jewish activity and potential anxiety; those include the
house (verse 1), the city (verse 1) and the family (verses 3-5).</font></p>
