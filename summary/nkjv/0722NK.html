	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2"><em><strong>Each of the following Hebrew verses begin with the letter </strong></em><strong>LAMED.</strong><br>
	    89 Forever, O LORD,<br />
Your word is settled in heaven. <br />
90 	Your faithfulness endures to all generations;<br />
You established the earth, and it abides. <br />
91 	They continue this day according to Your ordinances,<br />
For all are Your servants. <br />
92 	Unless Your law had been my delight,<br />
I would then have perished in my affliction. <br />
93 	I will never forget Your precepts,<br />
For by them You have given me life. <br />
94 	I am Yours, save me;<br />
For I have sought Your precepts. <br />
95 	The wicked wait for me to destroy me,<br />
But I will consider Your testimonies. <br />
96 	I have seen the consummation of all perfection,<br />
But Your commandment is exceedingly broad. <br />
</font></p>
	  <p><font size="2"><em><strong>Each of the following Hebrew verses begin with the letter </strong></em><strong>MEM.</strong><br>
	    97 	Oh, how I love Your law!<br />
It is my meditation all the day. <br />
98 	You, through Your commandments, make me wiser than my enemies;<br />
For they are ever with me. <br />
99 	I have more understanding than all my teachers,<br />
For Your testimonies are my meditation. <br />
100 I understand more than the ancients,<br />
Because I keep Your precepts. <br />
101 I have restrained my feet from every evil way,<br />
That I may keep Your word. <br />
102 I have not departed from Your judgments,<br />
For You Yourself have taught me. <br />
103 How sweet are Your words to my taste,<br />
Sweeter than honey to my mouth! <br />
104 Through Your precepts I get understanding;<br />
Therefore I hate every false way. <br />
</font></p>
	  <p><font size="2"><em><strong>Each of the following Hebrew verses begin with the letter </strong></em><strong>NUN.</strong><br>
	    105 Your word is a lamp to my feet<br />
And a light to my path. <br />
106 I have sworn and confirmed<br />
That I will keep Your righteous judgments. <br />
107 I am afflicted very much;<br />
Revive me, O LORD, according to Your word. <br />
108 Accept, I pray, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD,<br />
And teach me Your judgments. <br />
109 My life is continually in my hand,<br />
Yet I do not forget Your law. <br />
110 The wicked have laid a snare for me,<br />
Yet I have not strayed from Your precepts. <br />
111 Your testimonies I have taken as a heritage forever,<br />
For they are the rejoicing of my heart. <br />
112 I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes<br />
Forever, to the very end. <br />
</font></p>
	  <p><font size="2"><em><strong>Each of the following Hebrew verses begin with the letter </strong></em><strong>SAMECH.</strong><br>
	    113 I hate the double-minded,<br />
But I love Your law. <br />
114 You are my hiding place and my shield;<br />
I hope in Your word. <br />
115 Depart from me, you evildoers,<br />
For I will keep the commandments of my God! <br />
116 Uphold me according to Your word, that I may live;<br />
And do not let me be ashamed of my hope. <br />
117 Hold me up, and I shall be safe,<br />
And I shall observe Your statutes continually. <br />
118 You reject all those who stray from Your statutes,<br />
For their deceit is falsehood. <br />
119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross;<br />
Therefore I love Your testimonies. <br />
120 My flesh trembles for fear of You,<br />
And I am afraid of Your judgments. <br />
</font></p>
	  <p><font size="2"><em><strong>Each of the following Hebrew verses begin with the letter </strong></em><strong>AIN.</strong><br>
	    121 I have done justice and righteousness;<br />
Do not leave me to my oppressors. <br />
122 Be surety for Your servant for good;<br />
Do not let the proud oppress me. <br />
123 My eyes fail from seeking Your salvation<br />
And Your righteous word. <br />
124 Deal with Your servant according to Your mercy,<br />
And teach me Your statutes. <br />
125 I am Your servant;<br />
Give me understanding,<br />
That I may know Your testimonies. <br />
126 It is time for You to act, O LORD,<br />
For they have regarded Your law as void. <br />
127 Therefore I love Your commandments<br />
More than gold, yes, than fine gold! <br />
128 Therefore all Your precepts concerning all things<br />
I consider to be right;<br />
I hate every false way. <br />
</font></p>
	  <p><font size="2"><em><strong>Each of the following Hebrew verses begin with the letter </strong></em><strong>PE.</strong><br>
	    129 Your testimonies are wonderful;<br />
Therefore my soul keeps them. <br />
130 The entrance of Your words gives light;<br />
It gives understanding to the simple. <br />
131 I opened my mouth and panted,<br />
For I longed for Your commandments. <br />
132 Look upon me and be merciful to me,<br />
As Your custom is toward those who love Your name. <br />
133 Direct my steps by Your word,<br />
And let no iniquity have dominion over me. <br />
134 Redeem me from the oppression of man,<br />
That I may keep Your precepts. <br />
135 Make Your face shine upon Your servant,<br />
And teach me Your statutes. <br />

Because men do not keep Your law. <br />

And upright are Your judgments. <br />
138 Your testimonies, which You have commanded,<br />
Are righteous and very faithful. <br />
139 My zeal has consumed me,<br />
Because my enemies have forgotten Your words. <br />
140 Your word is very pure;<br />
Therefore Your servant loves it. <br />
141 I am small and despised,<br />
Yet I do not forget Your precepts. <br />
142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,<br />
And Your law is truth. <br />
143 Trouble and anguish have overtaken me,<br />

	<p> Virtually every verse mentions some aspect of God's direction in the Believer's life.</p>
	<p><b>Notice the different words used to describe God's direction in this Psalm:</b></p>

			<li>law(s): From Hebrew &quot;<i>torah</i>&quot; and is used 25 times; meaning &quot;a body of prophetic teaching.&quot; 
			<li>precept(s): From Hebrew &quot;<i>piqquwd</i>&quot; and is used 21 times; meaning &quot;a thing appointed.&quot;

			<li>way(s): From Hebrew &quot;<i>derek</i>&quot; and is used 18 times; meaning &quot;a road or path.&quot;

		</ul>
		<p>Verse 89 begins this reading with a strong promise regarding the permanence of God's Word, &quot;Forever, O LORD, Your word is settled in heaven.&quot; While the world treats truth as something that is relative, the truth of God's Word never changes because it is settled in Heaven. <b>Who wants a moving target, anyway?</b> It's wonderful to know that our God in Heaven has given us a living book for direction as is stated in verse 105, &quot;Your word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my path.&quot; That promise gives the Believer confidence in knowing exactly what God expects from us as it says in verse 165, &quot;Great peace have those who love Your law, And nothing causes them to stumble.&quot;</p>
	<p><b>Psalm 119 is a great chapter that instills confidence in the Book we, as Believers, carry as our guide to Christian living - the Bible.</b></p>
