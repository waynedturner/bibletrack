<p><font size="4"><b>Transcribed by Hezekiah's scholars<br>
				</b></font><b><font size="3">These three chapters are part of a group of five that started with </font></b><a title="Proverbs 25 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=12" target="_blank"><b><font size="3">Proverbs 25</font></b><font size="3"> (see notes)</font></a><b><font size="3">. </font></b>According to Proverbs 25:1, these are proverbs of Solomon, which the <b>men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</b> We find in these five chapters of Proverbs sayings with a little different format than we saw in the earlier chapters. These sayings, according to the introduction, were collected by King Hezekiah's men (715-686); Hezekiah is found in <a title="II Kings 18 and II Chronicles 29 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=24#Top" target="_blank">II Kings 18-20 and II Chronicles 29-32 (see notes)</a>. So, according to Proverbs 25:1, these proverbs in 25-29 were, indeed, written by Solomon, but not collected into book form until done so by Hezekiah's authority over 300 years later. Here, Solomon talks about reputation, integrity, wisdom and the fool.</p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>Some practical living tips from Solomon (Proverbs 27)<br>
			</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 Do not boast about tomorrow,<br>
For you do not know what a day may bring forth. <br>
2 	Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth;<br>
A stranger, and not your own lips. <br>
3 	A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,<br>
But a fool&rsquo;s wrath is heavier than both of them. <br>
4 	Wrath is cruel and anger a torrent,<br>
But who is able to stand before jealousy? <br>
5 	Open rebuke is better<br>
Than love carefully concealed. <br>
6 	Faithful are the wounds of a friend,<br>
But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. <br>
7 	A satisfied soul loathes the honeycomb,<br>
But to a hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. <br>
8 	Like a bird that wanders from its nest<br>
Is a man who wanders from his place. <br>
9 	Ointment and perfume delight the heart,<br>
And the sweetness of a man&rsquo;s friend gives delight by hearty counsel. <br>
10 	Do not forsake your own friend or your father&rsquo;s friend,<br>
Nor go to your brother&rsquo;s house in the day of your calamity;<br>
Better is a neighbor nearby than a brother far away. <br>
11 	My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,<br>
That I may answer him who reproaches me. <br>
12 	A prudent man foresees evil  and hides himself;<br>
The simple pass on and are punished. <br>
13 	Take the garment of him who is surety for a stranger,<br>
And hold it in pledge when he is surety for a seductress. <br>
14 	He who blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,<br>
It will be counted a curse to him. <br>
15 	A continual dripping on a very rainy day<br>
And a contentious woman are alike; <br>
16 	Whoever restrains her restrains the wind,<br>
And grasps oil with his right hand. <br>
17 	As iron sharpens iron,<br>
So a man sharpens the countenance of his friend. <br>
18 	Whoever keeps the fig tree will eat its fruit;<br>
So he who waits on his master will be honored. <br>
19 	As in water face reflects face,<br>
So a man&rsquo;s heart reveals the man. <br>
20 	Hell and Destruction are never full;<br>
So the eyes of man are never satisfied. <br>
21 	The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,<br>
And a man is valued by what others say of him. <br>
22 	Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain,<br>
Yet his foolishness will not depart from him. <br>
23 	Be diligent to know the state of your flocks,<br>
And attend to your herds; <br>
24 	For riches are not forever,<br>
Nor does a crown endure to all generations. <br>
25 	When the hay is removed, and the tender grass shows itself,<br>
And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in, <br>
26 	The lambs will provide your clothing,<br>
And the goats the price of a field; <br>
27 	 You shall have enough goats&rsquo; milk for your food,<br>
For the food of your household,<br>
And the nourishment of your maidservants. </font></p>

		</b></font>Proverbs 27:1 Do not boast about tomorrow, For you do not know what a day may bring forth.<br>
		    <i>God's got the plans.<br>
			    </i>Proverbs 27:2 Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; A stranger, and not your own lips.<br>
	        <i>Nobody likes a braggart.<br>

<p><a name="Wisdom"></a><font size="4"><b>Assorted wisdom (Proverbs 28)<br>
			</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 The wicked flee when no one pursues,<br>
But the righteous are bold as a lion. <br>
2 	Because of the transgression of a land, many are its princes;<br>
But by a man of understanding and knowledge<br>
Right will be prolonged. <br>
3 	A poor man who oppresses the poor<br>
Is like a driving rain which leaves no food. <br>
4 	Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,<br>
But such as keep the law contend with them. <br>
5 	Evil men do not understand justice,<br>
But those who seek the LORD understand all. <br>
6 	Better is the poor who walks in his integrity<br>
Than one perverse in his ways, though he be rich. <br>
7 	Whoever keeps the law is a discerning son,<br>
But a companion of gluttons shames his father. <br>
8 	One who increases his possessions by usury and extortion<br>
Gathers it for him who will pity the poor. <br>
9 	One who turns away his ear from hearing the law,<br>
Even his prayer is an abomination. <br>
10 	Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way,<br>
He himself will fall into his own pit;<br>
But the blameless will inherit good. <br>
11 	The rich man is wise in his own eyes,<br>
But the poor who has understanding searches him out. <br>
12 	When the righteous rejoice, there is great glory;<br>
But when the wicked arise, men hide themselves. <br>
13 	He who covers his sins will not prosper,<br>
But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy. <br>
14 	Happy is the man who is always reverent,<br>
But he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity. <br>
15 	Like a roaring lion and a charging bear<br>
Is a wicked ruler over poor people. <br>
16 	A ruler who lacks understanding is a great oppressor,<br>
But he who hates covetousness will prolong his days. <br>
17 	A man burdened with bloodshed will flee into a pit;<br>
Let no one help him. <br>
18 	Whoever walks blamelessly will be saved,<br>
But he who is perverse in his ways will suddenly fall. <br>
19 	He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,<br>
But he who follows frivolity will have poverty enough! <br>
20 	A faithful man will abound with blessings,<br>
But he who hastens to be rich will not go unpunished. <br>
21 	To show partiality is not good,<br>
Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress. <br>
22 	A man with an evil eye hastens after riches,<br>
And does not consider that poverty will come upon him. <br>
23 	He who rebukes a man will find more favor afterward<br>
Than he who flatters with the tongue. <br>
24 	Whoever robs his father or his mother,<br>
And says, &ldquo;It is no transgression,&rdquo;<br>
The same is companion to a destroyer. <br>
25 	He who is of a proud heart stirs up strife,<br>
But he who trusts in the LORD will be prospered. <br>
26 	He who trusts in his own heart is a fool,<br>
But whoever walks wisely will be delivered. <br>
27 	He who gives to the poor will not lack,<br>
But he who hides his eyes will have many curses. <br>
28 	When the wicked arise, men hide themselves;<br>
But when they perish, the righteous increase. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 He who is often rebuked, and hardens his neck,<br>
Will suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. <br>
2 	When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice;<br>
But when a wicked man rules, the people groan. <br>
3 	Whoever loves wisdom makes his father rejoice,<br>
But a companion of harlots wastes his wealth. <br>
4 	The king establishes the land by justice,<br>
But he who receives bribes overthrows it. <br>
5 	A man who flatters his neighbor<br>
Spreads a net for his feet. <br>
6 	By transgression an evil man is snared,<br>
But the righteous sings and rejoices. <br>
7 	The righteous considers the cause of the poor,<br>
But the wicked does not understand such knowledge. <br>
8 	Scoffers set a city aflame,<br>
But wise men turn away wrath. <br>
9 	If a wise man contends with a foolish man,<br>
Whether the fool rages or laughs, there is no peace. <br>
10 	The bloodthirsty hate the blameless,<br>
But the upright seek his well-being. <br>
11 	A fool vents all his feelings,<br>
But a wise man holds them back. <br>
12 	If a ruler pays attention to lies,<br>
All his servants become wicked. <br>
13 	The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:<br>
The LORD gives light to the eyes of both. <br>
14 	The king who judges the poor with truth,<br>
His throne will be established forever. <br>
15 	The rod and rebuke give wisdom,<br>
But a child left to himself brings shame to his mother. <br>
16 	When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increases;<br>
But the righteous will see their fall. <br>
17 	Correct your son, and he will give you rest;<br>
Yes, he will give delight to your soul. <br>
18 	Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;<br>
But happy is he who keeps the law. <br>
19 	A servant will not be corrected by mere words;<br>
For though he understands, he will not respond. <br>
20 	Do you see a man hasty in his words?<br>
There is more hope for a fool than for him. <br>
21 	He who pampers his servant from childhood<br>
Will have him as a son in the end. <br>
22 	An angry man stirs up strife,<br>
And a furious man abounds in transgression. <br>
23 	A man&rsquo;s pride will bring him low,<br>
But the humble in spirit will retain honor. <br>
24 	Whoever is a partner with a thief hates his own life;<br>
He swears to tell the truth, but reveals nothing. <br>
25 	The fear of man brings a snare,<br>
But whoever trusts in the LORD shall be safe. <br>
26 	Many seek the ruler&rsquo;s favor,<br>
But justice for man comes from the LORD. <br>
27 	An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous,<br>
And he who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked. </font></p>
