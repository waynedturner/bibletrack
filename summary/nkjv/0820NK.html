<p>The Boam boys, Rehoboam (Solomon's son) and Jeroboam (Solomon's chief superintendent of forced labor), are front and center after Solomon's death. The prophet Ahijah, back in <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=18#Jeroboam" target="_blank">I Kings 11:29-39 (see notes)</a>, had already spoken on behalf of God that Jeroboam would be King over 10 tribes. That being the case, these complications at Shechem are just a formality. <b>The representatives of the northern tribes speak up after Solomon's death and say to King Rehoboam, &quot;We're overtaxed and oppressed.&quot;</b> Rehoboam's senior advisers who had previously served Solomon give their counsel to Rehoboam by saying, &quot;They're overtaxed and oppressed.&quot; Rehoboam's childhood buddies (now advisors), however, prevail with their advice causing Rehoboam to reply to the 10 tribes, &quot;You think you're oppressed now, you ain't seen nothing yet!&quot; </p>
<p>Rehoboam makes a very bad decision, but in reality, it had already been prophesied by the prophet Ahijah that Israel would split ; this is the action by Rehoboam that gets credit for the division of the Kingdom of Israel into a Northern Kingdom and a Southern Kingdom. Keep in mind though, this isn't the real reason for the split. The real reason is found in <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=18#Solomon" target="_blank">I Kings 11:11 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, 'Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant.'&quot; That's right, God even speaks to Solomon and tells him that after his reign, his kingdom will be split - and all because of Solomon's tolerance for paganism.</p>

<p><strong>The inevitable happens</strong>; Israel splits. Since Simeon has been absorbed into Judah (<a title="Joshua 19 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=04&dy=26#Tribes" target="_blank">see details and map</a>), and Benjamin joins Judah here, doesn't that just leave 9 tribes for the Northern Kingdom of Israel? That is a fuzzy area in Jewish history. Many scholars believe that the largest portion of Benjamin sided with the Northern Kingdom while a few in Benjamin, in closer proximity to Judah, sided with the Southern Kingdom. In fact, Jerusalem was the capital of the Southern Kingdom and was located within the borders of the originally-prescribed Tribe of Benjamin. <b>So it appears that Judah's border was expanded to include a portion of Southern Benjamin after the split - taking in Jerusalem itself. Some of Benjamin's fighting men joined with Judah in verse 21.</b> We also see Judah's army in <a title="II Chronicles 14 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=23#Asa" target="_blank">II Chronicles 14:8 (see notes)</a> including 280,000 Benjamites. The only logical explanation is that <b>part of Benjamin</b> must have left the Northern Kingdom and joined with Judah as part of Judah itself. Property settlements after a divorce are almost always messy. Verse 20 says, &quot;...There was none who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.&quot;</p>
<p title="II Samuel 19 Summary"><b>So let's recap:</b> The prophet Ahijah in <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=18#Jeroboam" target="_blank">I Kings 11:29-39 (see notes)</a> divided Jeroboam's garment into 12 pieces, but then immediately prophesied that the pieces represent the Tribes of Israel. He then proclaimed that 10 tribes will follow Jeroboam and only one tribe will follow Rehoboam. Hey Ahijah! What about that piece of garment still lying there in the middle? While it's not explained in that passage, that must be the Tribe of Simeon; they never received their own distinct boundary lines in the distribution of property after the Canaan entry back in <a title="Joshua 19 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=04&dy=26" target="_blank">Joshua 19 (see notes)</a>. Instead, they received certain cities within the boundaries of Judah itself. Incidentally, this dividing out of the ten tribes is also seen in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=5#Barzillai" target="_blank">II Samuel 19:43 (see notes)</a> in that dispute between Judah and the other &quot;ten&quot; tribes. It seems certain that Simeon here must be included with Judah.</p>
	<p>Rehoboam can't seem to accept what has really happened here; he sends Adoram, his chief tax collector, to the Northern Tribes. Hey! Tax collectors aren't popular under the best of circumstances! The people of the Northern Tribes stone him to death. <b>Surely war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam is the only solution here.</b> But God says &quot;NO&quot; through the prophet Shemaiah, Rehoboam calls off the attack, and the two kingdoms remain intact. More about the war plans are found in <a title="II Chronicles 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=22#War" target="_blank">II Chronicles 11:1-12 (see notes)</a>.</p>

		<p>Jeroboam establishes Shechem as his capital city, but he perceives a little worship problem here. He can't have the folks going back to Jerusalem to sacrifice in the Temple; they might defect back to the old kingdom. <b>So, Jeroboam establishes a new pagan religion for the Northern Kingdom, complete with the return of not one, but two golden calves, non-Levite priests, a special Feast Day one month after the Feast of Tabernacles along with special altars</b>. As I said, we have a new religion for the Northern Kingdom. He placed the two golden calves in Israel for convenience. I Kings 12:29 says of these golden calves, &quot;And he set up one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.&quot; Well, so much for Ahijah's conditional promise from God to Jeroboam if he would serve the one true God back in <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=18#Jeroboam" target="_blank">I Kings 11:29-39 (see notes)</a>. Jeroboam never served God - not even from the very beginning.</p>
	<p>It's interesting that<b> Jeroboam quotes Aaron </b>after he commissions the worship of the golden calves in verse 28, &quot;...Here are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up from the land of Egypt!&quot; That's what Aaron said when he made his calf back in <a title="Exodus 32 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=23#Calf" target="_blank">Exodus 32:4 (see notes)</a>, <font size="3">&quot;And he received the gold from their hand, and he fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made a molded calf.

		    4 &para; So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, &ldquo;Arrest him!&rdquo; Then his hand, which he stretched out toward him, withered, so that he could not pull it back to himself. <br>
		    5 The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. <br>
		    6 Then the king answered and said to the man of God, &ldquo;Please entreat the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.&rdquo; &para; So the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king&rsquo;s hand was restored to him, and became as before. <br>
		    7 Then the king said to the man of God, &ldquo;Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.&rdquo; <br>
		    8 &para; But the man of God said to the king, &ldquo;If you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place. <br>
		    9 For so it was commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, &ldquo;You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you came.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
	      10 So he went another way and did not return by the way he came to Bethel. </font></p>

	<p>Hint: God doesn't like Jeroboam's new religion. A unnamed man of God comes from the Southern Kingdom while Jeroboam is worshipping at his own home-built altar. He makes a prophecy of death and defilement against that altar to Jeroboam and withers Jeroboam's hand. At Jeroboam's pleading, he restores his hand, but he doesn't repair the altar that just split in two before Jeroboam's eyes. <b>However, the prophecy isn't retracted; we'll see it fulfilled in </b><a title="II Kings 23 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=17#Try" target="_blank"><b>II Kings 23:15-20</b> (see notes)</a><b> during the reign of King Josiah of Judah 300 years or so later.</b> At that time, Josiah does everything prophesied in verse 2 as he institutes reforms after the fall of the Northern Kingdom. Jeroboam makes an offer of hospitality toward the prophet, but he refuses; the prophet had been told not to lodge in the land, but to head straight back to Judah.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>My angel trumps your angel (I Kings 13:11-34)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2">11 &para; Now an old prophet dwelt in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king. <br>
  12 And their father said to them, &ldquo;Which way did he go?&rdquo; For his sons had seen which way the man of God went who came from Judah. <br>
  13 Then he said to his sons, &ldquo;Saddle the donkey for me.&rdquo; So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it, <br>
  14 and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. Then he said to him, &ldquo;Are you the man of God who came from Judah?&rdquo; &para; And he said, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; <br>
  15 &para; Then he said to him, &ldquo;Come home with me and eat bread.&rdquo; <br>
  16 &para; And he said, &ldquo;I cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place. <br>
  17 For I have been told by the word of the LORD, &ldquo;You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
  18 &para; He said to him, &ldquo;I too am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, &lsquo;Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; (He was lying to him.) <br>
  19 &para; So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water. <br>
  20 &para; Now it happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back; <br>
  21 and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD, and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you, <br>
  22 but you came back, ate bread, and drank water in the place of which the LORD said to you, &ldquo;Eat no bread and drink no water,&rdquo; your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
  23 &para; So it was, after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, the prophet whom he had brought back. <br>
  24 When he was gone, a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his corpse was thrown on the road, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the corpse. <br>
  25 And there, men passed by and saw the corpse thrown on the road, and the lion standing by the corpse. Then they went and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. <br>
  26 &para; Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard it, he said, &ldquo;It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the LORD. Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to him.&rdquo; <br>
  27 And he spoke to his sons, saying, &ldquo;Saddle the donkey for me.&rdquo; So they saddled it.<br>
  28 Then he went and found his corpse thrown on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey. <br>
  29 And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. So the old prophet came to the city to mourn, and to bury him. <br>
  30 Then he laid the corpse in his own tomb; and they mourned over him, saying, &ldquo;Alas, my brother!&rdquo; <br>
  31 So it was, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, &ldquo;When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. <br>
  32 For the saying which he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the shrines on the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely come to pass.&rdquo; <br>
  33 &para; After this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but again he made priests from every class of people for the high places; whoever wished, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places. <br>
  34 And this thing was the sin of the house of Jeroboam, so as to exterminate and destroy it from the face of the earth. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">You'll recall from the first 10 verses that the bold prophet who confronted Jeroboam was not to lodge in the land. But what if another prophet claims to have a word from the Lord that supersedes your word? Despite his personal orders from God, the bold prophet agrees to lodge with a local prophet. The local prophet claims he received a contradictory word from the Lord making it acceptable to lodge with him.</font> The events that follow are ironic. The lying prophet (the duper), while hosting the prophet (the dupee) who warned Jeroboam, then gets a prophecy condemning the action of the other prophet for heeding his own so-called &quot;word from the Lord.&quot; You just can't trust anybody these days. He prophesies the bold prophet's death. Who's going to do the execution? How about we let a lion do it? After the bold prophet is slain by the lion, the lying prophet feels great remorse. He collects the bones of the bold prophet and has them placed in his own sepulcher. <b>There must be a lesson here for all of us: When you are certain the Lord has given you direction, don't allow yourself to be sidetracked by others - regardless of the title they use to identify themselves.</b></p>
<p>Jeroboam just continues on, emboldened with his new false, pagan religion - appoints more rotten priests and even becomes one himself. Well, here's the sad result of Jeroboam's life in verse 34, &quot;And this thing was the sin of the house of Jeroboam, so as to exterminate and destroy it from the face of the earth.&quot;</p>
<p><a name="Hard"></a><font size="4"><b>It's hard to get a good prophecy when you're an evil king (I Kings 14:1-20)<br>

		<p><font size="2">1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick. <br>
		  2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, &ldquo;Please arise, and disguise yourself, that they may not recognize you as the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Indeed, Ahijah the prophet is there, who told me that I would be king over this people. <br>
		  3 Also take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will tell you what will become of the child.&rdquo; <br>
		  4 And Jeroboam&rsquo;s wife did so; she arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were glazed by reason of his age. <br>
		  5 &para; Now the LORD had said to Ahijah, &ldquo;Here is the wife of Jeroboam, coming to ask you something about her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus you shall say to her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.&rdquo; <br>
		  6 &para; And so it was, when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, &ldquo;Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another person? For I have been sent to you with bad news.<br>
		  7 Go, tell Jeroboam, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD God of Israel: &lsquo;Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you ruler over My people Israel, <br>
		  8 and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to you; and yet you have not been as My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only what was right in My eyes; <br>
		  9 but you have done more evil than all who were before you, for you have gone and made for yourself other gods and molded images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back&mdash; <br>
		  10 therefore behold! I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male in Israel, bond and free; I will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as one takes away refuse until it is all gone. <br>
		  11 The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field; for the LORD has spoken!&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; <br>
		  12 Arise therefore, go to your own house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die. <br>
		  13 And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something good toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. <br>
		  14 &para; &ldquo;Moreover the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam; this is the day. What? Even now! <br>
		  15 For the LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their wooden images, provoking the LORD to anger. <br>
		  16 And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and who made Israel sin.&rdquo; <br>
		  17 &para; Then Jeroboam&rsquo;s wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah. When she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. <br>
		  18 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet. <br>
		  19 &para; Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. <br>
	    20 The period that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years. So he rested with his fathers. Then Nadab his son reigned in his place. </font></p>
	<p>Jeroboam's son (Abijah) is sick, and he needs a little prophetic knowledge concerning him. He remembers the prophet who told him he'd be king, Ahijah, back in <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=18#Jeroboam" target="_blank">I Kings 11:29-39 (see notes)</a>. Jeroboam has his wife disguise herself and head out to see Ahijah. So, what does a good prophetic reading cost? About 10 loaves of bread, some cake and a jar of honey - at least that's how Jeroboam valued it. Now please...if Ahijah was a real prophet of God (and he was), wouldn't it just make sense that Jeroboam's wife's disguise was not gonna fool him? Yup, as should have been expected, though his eyesight was poor, he knew...and prophesied that, because of Jeroboam's sin, the child would die upon her return...and that's exactly what happened. But wait! There's more! He also prophesied that Jeroboam's lineage would be cut off. After 22 years of reigning on the throne in Israel, Jeroboam dies, leaving the throne to another son, Nadab, but he was killed two years later in <a title="I Kings 15 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=24#Nadab" target="_blank">I Kings 15:25-34 (see notes)</a>, resulting in the extinction of Jeroboam's descendants, thus marking the end of the Northern Kingdom's first dynasty.</p>
	<p><b>Notice particularly I Kings 14:8 regarding David, </b>&quot;...and yet you have not been as My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only what was right in My eyes.&quot; With all of David's shortcomings, disobedience toward God was not one of them. <b>That's why it is said of David that he was a man after God's own heart.</b> <a title="I Samuel 13 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=15#Saul" target="_blank">For more insight on David's heart for God, click here.</a></p>
	<p>Incidentally, all of the modern translations, including the NKJV, have cleaned up the KJV language of verse 10 where males are referred to as those &quot;that pisseth against the wall.&quot; In actuality, that is precisely what the Hebrew text says in that passage. It's a Hebrew idiom used another five times in the Old Testament as a reference to males. The editors of the KJV simply transferred the Hebrew idiom into English rather than making an attempt to culturally sanitize it for us.</p>

His mother&rsquo;s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. <br>
              22 Now Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done. <br>
              23 For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and wooden images on every high hill and under every green tree. <br>
              24 And there were also perverted persons in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. <br>

		<p>Solomon's son, Rehoboam, isn't doing any better with Judah. He's the son of Solomon and an Ammonite woman (a problem right from the beginning). Rehoboam is an evil King in Judah - worships pagan gods and even allows male homosexual prostitutes in the land. He has a 17-year rocky ride as King of the Southern Kingdom, Judah. Being continually at war with Jeroboam added to his losing campaign against the Egyptian king (Shishak) who comes in and takes all of Solomon's accumulated wealth from the palace and temple. As I said - a tough 17 years, and then he dies.</p>
