	<p>There still hasn't been a Godly king in Israel (Hint: and there won't
	  be). Jeroboam's son, Nadab, becomes King of Israel (yeah, he's bad
	  too). Then <b>Baasha kills Nadab</b> and subsequently turns loose on all of Jeroboam's descendants and kills them also - guess no more kings from Jeroboam, just as the prophet Ahijah had said (<a title="I Kings 14 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=20#Hard" target="_blank">I Kings 14:14, see notes</a>). Why? The answer is in <a title="I Kings 14 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=20#Hard" target="_blank">I Kings 14:1-20 (see notes)</a>; <b>Jeroboam was evil in the sight of God - stated again here in I Kings 15:30.</b> Now it's King Baasha...and, of course, he's bad too - just couldn't bring himself to serve God. <b>It just never became a

    </blockquote>
	<p>Could the prophet, Jehu, have given a more negative prophecy concerning King Baasha of Israel? He declares that his lineage won't continue as kings over Israel. (Is it any wonder that the Israeli kings hated God's prophets?) His condemnation by the word of the prophet was because of Baasha's treachery and general state of evilness. He's followed by his son, Elah. We're now into the second dynasty of the newly-formed Northern Kingdom of Israel, and this dynasty will soon close out with the death of Baasha's son, Elah.</p>
		<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Elah"></a>A short reign for Elah (I Kings 16:8-14)</b></font> </p>
<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">8 &para; In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel, and reigned two years in Tirzah. <br>
		    9 Now his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, steward of his house in Tirzah. <br>
		    10 And Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place. <br>
		    11 &para; Then it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he was seated on his throne, that he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave him one male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends. <br>
		    12 Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, <br>
		    13 for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, by which they had sinned and by which they had made Israel sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols. <br>
	      14 &para; Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </font></p>
    </blockquote>
<p>So, <b>Baasha dies, and Elah, his boy, becomes King of Israel - but only for two years.</b> <b>Zimri, one of the Israeli army commanders, kills him and takes over as King of Israel.</b>
		  He also wipes out the entirety of Baasha/Elah's male descendants to put
		  to rest once and for all the prophecy of Jehu against Baasha. <b>This
		    slaying of Baasha's male descendants is expressed in a very interesting
		    way in the Hebrew text. Of translations in wide usage today, only the King James Version keeps the Hebrew
		    phrase intact in I Kings 16:11;</b> that's exactly how the Hebrew phrase identifies these male heirs (KJV-&quot;he left him not one that pisseth against a wall&quot;). We are told in verse 12 that this treachery was in accordance with Jehu's prophecy declaring the end of Baasha's dynasty. In addition, we see that Zimri not only slays the male heirs, but also Elah's other male relatives and even his male friends.</p>

		  the whole 7 days. <b>Whoa! Israel's Northern Kingdom is a tough place to serve as king;</b> it seems the moment you get the crown, someone is after your head. </p>
	<p>The dynasty math gets a little fuzzy here. Zimri was king (sorta) for only seven days after he killed Elah. Omri, who became the next king was not related to Zimri. Would you call Zimri's seven-day reign a dynasty? Since the definition of a dynasty is &quot;the succession of rulers from the same family,&quot; I guess Zimri by himself, does not constitute a dynasty. <strong>For seven days we're between dynasties two and three.</strong></p>

		    30 Now Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him. <br>
		    31 And it came to pass, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal and worshiped him. <br>
		    32 Then he set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. <br>
		    33 And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him. <br>

    </blockquote>
<p><b>Omri's boy, Ahab, becomes King of Israel;</b>
		  his wife, Jezebel, helps make his reign a notable one. Jezebel's father
		  was Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians. Sidon (home of the Zidonians) was a
		  Philistine city north of Israel on the coast. <b>Why don't parents name their daughters &quot;Jezebel?&quot;</b> As we read, it may become apparent. He and Jezebel were way into Baal worship - built a worship center to Baal in Samaria. He also set up &quot;a wooden image&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;asherah&quot;), which was actually a wooden image, or a pillar representing Ashtoreth, a sensual Canaanitish goddess. In pagan societies, she often served as the female complement to Baal. In gleaning from the usage in the Old Testament, it is commonly believed that &quot;Ashtoreth&quot; was the proper name of the goddess, while &quot;Asherah&quot; was the name of her image or symbol, which was constructed of wood.</p>
		<p><b>Ahab and Jezebel had no use for God or the things of God. </b>Ahab commissions the rebuilding of Jericho despite the prophecy of Joshua against doing so in <a title="Joshua 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=21#Jericho" target="_blank">Joshua 6:26 (see notes)</a> &quot;Then Joshua charged them at that time, saying, 'Cursed be the man before the LORD who rises up and builds this city Jericho; he shall lay its foundation with his firstborn, and with his youngest he shall set up its gates.'&quot; And...just as the prophecy had stated, Hiel, the man commissioned to the rebuilding project, loses his eldest and youngest sons, just as Joshua had said (verse 34).</p>
	<p>Ahab and Jezebel are two very colorful and evil figures in Israel's history. <b>Ahab is credited with a unique distinction in verse 33</b>, "Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him." <b>How's that for the record books!</b></p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel. <br>
		    2 And he placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken. <br>
		    3 Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of his father David; he did not seek the Baals, <br>
		    4 but sought the God of his father, and walked in His commandments and not according to the acts of Israel. <br>
		    5 Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave presents to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance. <br>
		    6 And his heart took delight in the ways of the LORD; moreover he removed the high places and wooden images from Judah. <br>
		    7 &para; Also in the third year of his reign he sent his leaders, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. <br>
		    8 And with them he sent Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah&mdash;the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. <br>
		    9 So they taught in Judah, and had the Book of the Law of the LORD with them; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people. <br>
		    10 &para; And the fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat. <br>
		    11 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver as tribute; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats. <br>
		    12 &para; So Jehoshaphat became increasingly powerful, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah. <br>
		    13 He had much property in the cities of Judah; and the men of war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem. <br>
		    14 &para; These are their numbers, according to their fathers&rsquo; houses. Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor; <br>
		    15 and next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand; <br>
		    16 and next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor. <br>
		    17 Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield; <br>
		    18 and next to him was Jehozabad, and with him one hundred and eighty thousand prepared for war. <br>
	      19 These served the king, besides those the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah. </font></p>

	<p>While the Northern Kingdom was screaming through a line of kings, the Southern Kingdom gets <b>Jehoshaphat</b> as their king, mentioned first in <a title="I Kings 15 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=23#Asa" target="_blank">I Kings 15:24 (see notes)</a> as the successor to his father, Asa. <b>Jehoshaphat was a good king,</b> as his Dad (Asa) was early in his reign. Like his Dad, he got rid of the &quot;high places&quot; at the beginning of his reign, but we see by <a title="II Chronicles 20 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=30#Aftermath" target="_blank">II Chronicles 20:33 (see notes)</a> that they later reappeared, and he let it go. <b>Fighting idol worship was a constant uphill battle among the Jews. </b>But look at Jehoshaphat's army. I count it to be altogether well over 1 million strong! No wonder all the kings around him were sending gifts. He was zealous in the ways of the Lord - even sending priests and teachers out to the people of Israel to teach them the ways of the One True God. Jehoshaphat stays around through chapter 20. And he gets a lot of coverage in I and II Kings as well, from I Kings 15 all the way to II Kings 8 when his son, Jehoram, begins to reign.</p>
