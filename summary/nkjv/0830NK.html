			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned safely to his house in Jerusalem. <br>
    2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King Jehoshaphat, &ldquo;Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Therefore the wrath of the LORD is upon you. <br>
    3 Nevertheless good things are found in you, in that you have removed the wooden images from the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God.&rdquo; <br>
    4 &para; So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD God of their fathers. <br>
    5 Then he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, <br>
    6 and said to the judges, &ldquo;Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment. <br>
    7 Now therefore, let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take care and do it, for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.&rdquo; <br>
    8 &para; Moreover in Jerusalem, for the judgment of the LORD and for controversies, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests, and some of the chief fathers of Israel, when they returned to Jerusalem. <br>
    9 And he commanded them, saying, &ldquo;Thus you shall act in the fear of the LORD, faithfully and with a loyal heart: <br>
    10 Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities, whether of bloodshed or offenses against law or commandment, against statutes or ordinances, you shall warn them, lest they trespass against the LORD and wrath come upon you and your brethren. Do this, and you will not be guilty. <br>
  11 And take notice: Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king&rsquo;s matters; also the Levites will be officials before you. Behave courageously, and the LORD will be with the good.&rdquo; </font></p>

<p>In <a title="II Chronicles 18 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=28#Battle" target="_blank">II Chronicles 18:28-34 (see notes)</a>, we saw that Judah's King Jehoshaphat had a close brush with death in his attempt to help his buddy, the wicked King Ahab of Israel, fight the Syrians. When Jehoshaphat gets back from battle, his own prophet, Jehu, goes out to meet him with some bad news, &quot;You shouldn't help wicked people!&quot; <b>He lets Jehoshaphat know that God is not pleased and that he should expect some wrath from God because of his unsuccessful battle fling with Ahab. </b>However, God is pleased with Jehoshaphat in this respect: he had (NKJV) &quot;removed the wooden images&quot; (removed the wooden images to the goddess Asherah) from the land. God also commends Jehoshaphat for having &quot;a loyal heart.&quot; </p>
<p><b>Jehoshaphat goes on a tear instituting some Godly reforms in Judah with which God is very pleased.  </b>These reforms included establishing godly judges, empowering the Levites, and setting up the High Priest, Amariah, over them. He also appoints a man named Zebadiah to oversee judgment regarding &quot;the king's matters.&quot; You will notice in verse 4 that Jehoshaphat's influence apparently reached up into the Northern Kingdom (Mount Ephraim) with regard to worship of the One True God.</p>
<p><a name="Warfare"></a><font size="4"><b>When conventional warfare just won't work (II Chronicles 20:1-23)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 It happened after this that the people of Moab with the people of Ammon, and others with them besides the Ammonites, came to battle against Jehoshaphat. <br>
    2 Then some came and told Jehoshaphat, saying, &ldquo;A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and they are in Hazazon Tamar&rdquo; (which is En Gedi). <br>
    3 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. <br>
    4 So Judah gathered together to ask help from the LORD; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD. <br>
    5 &para; Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court, <br>
    6 and said: &ldquo;O LORD God of our fathers, are You not God in heaven, and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and in Your hand is there not power and might, so that no one is able to withstand You? <br>
    7 Are You not our God, who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel, and gave it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever? <br>
    8 And they dwell in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name, saying, <br>
    9 &ldquo;If disaster comes upon us&mdash;sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine&mdash;we will stand before this temple and in Your presence (for Your name is in this temple), and cry out to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.&rsquo; <br>
    10 And now, here are the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir&mdash;whom You would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them and did not destroy them&mdash; <br>
    11 here they are, rewarding us by coming to throw us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit. <br>
    12 O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.&rdquo; <br>
    13 &para; Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, stood before the LORD. <br>
    14 &para; Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly. <br>
    15 And he said, &ldquo;Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the LORD to you: &lsquo;Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God&rsquo;s. <br>
    16 Tomorrow go down against them. They will surely come up by the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Jeruel. <br>
    17 You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the LORD, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!&rsquo; Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, for the LORD is with you.&rdquo; <br>
    18 &para; And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the LORD, worshiping the LORD. <br>
    19 Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with voices loud and high. <br>
    20 &para; So they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, &ldquo;Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in the LORD your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.&rdquo; <br>
    21 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the LORD, and who should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying:<br>
&ldquo;Praise the LORD,<br>
For His mercy endures forever.&rdquo; <br>
22 &para; Now when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated. <br>
23 For the people of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another. <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>A combined force of three armies are on their way to Jerusalem, the Moabites, Ammonites and Edomites. </b>What will Jehoshaphat do? <b>He gathers all of Judah together, and they have a prayer meeting accompanied by fasting; he leads in verses 6-12.</b> Verse 13 indicates the magnitude of this prayer gathering, &quot;Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, stood before the LORD.&quot; I'm amused by one of the points in Jehoshaphat's prayer found in verse 10 where he implies in his prayer, &quot;If you had let our forefathers destroy these people, we wouldn't be having this problem right now.&quot; That's a recall of God's instructions to Moses back in <a title="Deuteronomy 2 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=4#Recap" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 2:5 (see notes)</a> to not war against any of the three of these nations. Just at the conclusion of his big public prayer, Jahaziel, one of the Levites, gets a prophetic word from God and starts speaking in verses 14-17. <b>God tells them the battle is not theirs, but God's.</b> All they have to do is show up; God will do the rest. </p>
<p>The next day, Jehoshaphat rolls out his new battle plan before the people in verses 20-21; we're just going to organize a big praise-God session and let God defeat the enemy. Oh, one more thing - singers; <b>Jehoshaphat puts singers in front of his army.</b> Hey...singing in that choir wasn't for the faint of heart! Of course it all worked out; the invading armies get confused in their ambush attempts (wouldn't you, if you came up against an army led by the choir) and turn on each other, wiping themselves out without Judah's army lifting a hand...except for the choir, of course. So, the Ammonites and Moabites mistakenly end up attacking the Edomites (inhabitants of Mount Seir) until everyone is destroyed.</p>
<p><a name="Aftermath"></a><font size="4"><b>The aftermath (II Chronicles 20:24-30)</b></font><br>
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">24 &para; So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and there were their dead bodies, fallen on the earth. No one had escaped. <br>
    25 &para; When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much. <br>
    26 And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed the LORD; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah until this day. <br>
    27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies. <br>
    28 So they came to Jerusalem, with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets, to the house of the LORD. <br>
    29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel. <br>
    30 Then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.  <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jehoshaphat stuck with God, and God rewarded him for it. At the conclusion of the battle, the entire enemy army - all the soldiers - were dead; no one escaped. When they started taking the spoil from the battle they had won without fighting, they couldn't even carry it all. </p>
<p><font size="4"><b>A summary of Jehoshaphat's reign (II Chronicles 20:31-37)</b></font><br>
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">31 &para; So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother&rsquo;s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. <br>
    32 And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD. <br>
    33 Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not directed their hearts to the God of their fathers. <br>
    34 &para; Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, indeed they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel. <br>
    35 &para; After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted very wickedly. <br>
    36 And he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion Geber. <br>
  37 But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, &ldquo;Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works.&rdquo; Then the ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jehoshaphat served God all his days. <b>However, he didn't continually purge Judah from those pagan altars called &quot;high places.&quot;</b> The people built them back; it was an uphill battle. Jehoshaphat dies, but not before he and the King of Israel (Ahaziah) go into a ship-building venture together. God is unhappy about this business with a wicked king; the ships wreck. <b>Jehoshaphat consulted God in battle, but not in his business venture into ship building.</b><br>

              2 He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. <br>
              3 Their father gave them great gifts of silver and gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn. <br>
              4 &para; Now when Jehoram was established over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also others of the princes of Israel. <br>
              5 &para; Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. <br>
              6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for he had the daughter of Ahab as a wife; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD. <br>
              7 Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever. <br>
              8 &para; In his days Edom revolted against Judah&rsquo;s authority, and made a king over themselves. <br>
              9 So Jehoram went out with his officers, and all his chariots with him. And he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots. <br>
              10 Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah&rsquo;s authority to this day. At that time Libnah revolted against his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. <br>
              11 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, and led Judah astray. <br>
              12 &para; And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says the LORD God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah, <br>
              13 but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot like the harlotry of the house of Ahab, and also have killed your brothers, those of your father&rsquo;s household, who were better than yourself, <br>
              14 behold, the LORD will strike your people with a serious affliction&mdash;your children, your wives, and all your possessions; <br>
              15 and you will become very sick with a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day. <br>
              16 &para; Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians. <br>
              17 And they came up into Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king&rsquo;s house, and also his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. <br>
              18 &para; After all this the LORD struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease. <br>
              19 Then it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died in severe pain. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning for his fathers. <br>
            20 &para; He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and, to no one&rsquo;s sorrow, departed. However they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. </font></td>

		<p>Jehoshaphat, like a good father, provides for his sons after his death. He gives them their own cities and makes them princes over those cities. <b>Jehoram, his firstborn son, becomes king.</b> So, Jehoram, now that you're king, what are you going to do? Reply? &quot;Kill all my brothers! What do you expect?&quot; Not only does he execute his brothers, but also some other &quot;princes&quot; (government officials).

The son of the good king of Judah, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram was married to Athaliah, the daughter of Israel's King Ahab and Jezebel. With a wife like that, of course he was very evil. King Jehoram of Israel reigned from 852-841 and is found in II Kings 3. He was the son of Ahab and Jezebel, and successor to his brother Ahaziah on the throne of Israel.

<p>II Kings 8:26 reports that Ahaziah was actually 22 years old when he began to reign. Given the fact that his father, Jehoram, was only 40 years old when he died, it is certain that Ahaziah was 22 years old when his reign began (as reported in II Kings 8:26); his mama was Athaliah and served as his counselor; she was wicked. Just like his father, Jehoram, <b>Ahaziah never did the right thing before God;</b> he was wicked too. <b>He becomes an ally with King Jehoram, the son of Ahab and King of Israel. </b>Maybe he was impressed that Jehoram had the same name as his own wicked father.

<p>This is where the whole descendancy-from-David-thing gets messy. Remember Ahaziah's (who's now dead) wicked mama, Athaliah? She must have taken wickedness lessons from her mama, Jezebel. <b>After her son Ahaziah is executed by Jehu, she decides it's time Judah has a queen instead of a king. She locates and kills the royal family. At least she thinks she has executed all the possible heirs to the throne of Judah.</b> Remember, in Judah they were adamant about their king being a direct descendant of David. <b>Athaliah misses one though - little baby Joash who was hidden away by Ahaziah's half sister, Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram and  wife of Jehoiada (the priest).</b> Baby Joash was in hiding for six years while the wicked Athaliah reigned as queen over Judah. Ironic...isn't it. Athaliah's daddy was the wicked King of Israel, Ahab (now deceased), and here she is picking up the reign over Judah. </p>
