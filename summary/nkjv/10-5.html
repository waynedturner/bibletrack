		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;Comfort, yes, comfort My people!&rdquo;<br>
Says your God. <br>
2 	&ldquo;Speak comfort to Jerusalem, and cry out to her,<br>
That her warfare is ended,<br>
That her iniquity is pardoned;<br>
For she has received from the LORD&rsquo;S hand<br>
Double for all her sins.&rdquo; <br>
3 	The voice of one crying in the wilderness:<br>
&ldquo;Prepare the way of the LORD;<br>
Make straight in the desert<br>
A highway for our God. <br>
4 	Every valley shall be exalted<br>
And every mountain and hill brought low;<br>
The crooked places shall be made straight<br>
And the rough places smooth; <br>
5 	The glory of the LORD shall be revealed,<br>
And all flesh shall see it together;<br>
For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.&rdquo; <br>
6 	The voice said, &ldquo;Cry out!&rdquo;<br>
And he said, &ldquo;What shall I cry?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;All flesh is grass,<br>
And all its loveliness is like the flower of the field. <br>
7 	The grass withers, the flower fades,<br>
Because the breath of the LORD blows upon it;<br>
Surely the people are grass. <br>
8 	The grass withers, the flower fades,<br>
But the word of our God stands forever.&rdquo; <br>
9 	O Zion,<br>
You who bring good tidings,<br>
Get up into the high mountain;<br>
O Jerusalem,<br>
You who bring good tidings,<br>
Lift up your voice with strength,<br>
Lift it up, be not afraid;<br>
Say to the cities of Judah, &ldquo;Behold your God!&rdquo; <br>
10 	Behold, the Lord GOD shall come with a strong hand,<br>
And His arm shall rule for Him;<br>
Behold, His reward is with Him,<br>
And His work before Him. <br>
11 	He will feed His flock like a shepherd;<br>
He will gather the lambs with His arm,<br>
And carry them in His bosom,<br>
And gently lead those who are with young. <br>
12 	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand,<br>
Measured heaven with a span<br>
And calculated the dust of the earth in a measure?<br>
Weighed the mountains in scales<br>
And the hills in a balance? <br>
13 	Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD,<br>
Or as His counselor has taught Him? <br>
14 	With whom did He take counsel, and who instructed Him,<br>
And taught Him in the path of justice?<br>
Who taught Him knowledge,<br>
And showed Him the way of understanding? <br>
15 	Behold, the nations are as a drop in a bucket,<br>
And are counted as the small dust on the scales;<br>
Look, He lifts up the isles as a very little thing. <br>
16 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn,<br>
Nor its beasts sufficient for a burnt offering. <br>
17 	All nations before Him are as nothing,<br>
And they are counted by Him less than nothing and worthless. <br>
18 	To whom then will you liken God?<br>
Or what likeness will you compare to Him? <br>
19 	The workman molds an image,<br>
The goldsmith overspreads it with gold,<br>
And the silversmith casts silver chains. <br>
20 	Whoever is too impoverished for such a contribution<br>
Chooses a tree that will not rot;<br>
He seeks for himself a skillful workman<br>
To prepare a carved image that will not totter. <br>
21 	Have you not known?<br>
Have you not heard?<br>
Has it not been told you from the beginning?<br>
Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? <br>
22 	It is He who sits above the circle of the earth,<br>
And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers,<br>
Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,<br>
And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in. <br>
23 	He brings the princes to nothing;<br>
He makes the judges of the earth useless. <br>
24 	Scarcely shall they be planted,<br>
Scarcely shall they be sown,<br>
Scarcely shall their stock take root in the earth,<br>
When He will also blow on them,<br>
And they will wither,<br>
And the whirlwind will take them away like stubble. <br>
25 	&ldquo;To whom then will you liken Me,<br>
Or to whom shall I be equal?&rdquo; says the Holy One. <br>
26 	Lift up your eyes on high,<br>
And see who has created these things,<br>
Who brings out their host by number;<br>
He calls them all by name,<br>
By the greatness of His might<br>
And the strength of His power;<br>
Not one is missing. <br>
27 	Why do you say, O Jacob,<br>
And speak, O Israel:<br>
&ldquo;My way is hidden from the LORD,<br>
And my just claim is passed over by my God&rdquo;? <br>
28 	Have you not known?<br>
Have you not heard?<br>
The everlasting God, the LORD,<br>
The Creator of the ends of the earth,<br>
Neither faints nor is weary.<br>
His understanding is unsearchable. <br>
29 	He gives power to the weak,<br>
And to those who have no might He increases strength. <br>
30 	Even the youths shall faint and be weary,<br>
And the young men shall utterly fall, <br>
31 	But those who wait on the LORD<br>
Shall renew their strength;<br>
They shall mount up with wings like eagles,<br>
They shall run and not be weary,<br>
They shall walk and not faint. </font></p>

	<p>In the preceding chapter 39, Isaiah has just prophesied that the Babylonians would capture Jerusalem. I<b>nterestingly enough, Babylon had not yet risen to power in the world; they were still a vassal state of the Assyrians.</b> Certainly enough, though, after Hezekiah's death, in 586 B.C. Jerusalem did fall to the newly-founded Babylonian Empire (<a href="11-4.html#Jerusalem" title="II Kings 24-25 Summary" target="_blank">II Kings 24-25, see notes</a>). This chapter recites Isaiah's prophecy of the restoration of Jerusalem, the return from Babylonian exile some 70 years later and finally the restoration that will one day be made possible by the Messiah. As a matter of fact, the next 9 chapters deal with this restoration.</p>
	<p><b>The Messianic message of chapter 40 is framed nicely for us with the New Testament appearance of John the Baptist.</b> John was asked to identify himself, and notice his reply in <a title="John 1 Summary" href="1-13.html#Identify" target="_blank">John 1:23 (see notes)</a>, &quot;He said: 'I am 	The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 	&quot;Make straight the way of the LORD,&quot;' as the prophet Isaiah said.&quot; John identified himself as the &quot;voice&quot; of Isaiah 40:3 proclaiming the Messiah. <a title="John-Elijah.html" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/John-Elijah.html" target="_blank">(To see more detail on John the Baptist's fulfillment of prophecy, click here.)</a> As is obvious, all the provisions of Isaiah 40 were not fulfilled at the first advent of Jesus Christ. <b>This complete restoration will be seen during the Messianic Kingdom, which is yet future to us.</b></p>
	<p>By the way, with regard to the permanence of the Gospel of salvation, Peter quotes from Isaiah 40:6-8 in <a title="I Peter 1 Summary" href="11-25.html#You" target="_blank">I Peter 1:24-25 (see notes)</a> when he says, &quot;because 	'All flesh is as grass, 	And all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. 	The grass withers, 	And its flower falls away, 	But the word of the LORD endures forever.' Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you.&quot;</p>
	<p><b>Chapter 40 is divided into two parts:</b></p>
	<ul>
	  <li> The first 11 verses prophesy the Messiah and his predecessor, the messenger sent to announce his coming. </li>
      <li>Verses 12-30 list the magnificent attributes of God for us. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then the capper, verse 31, &quot;But those who wait on the LORD 	Shall renew their strength; 	They shall mount up with wings like eagles, 	They shall run and not be weary, 	They shall walk and not faint.&quot; This oft-quoted verse encourages us to be patient; God works in his own time.</p>

		  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;Keep silence before Me, O coastlands,<br>

Let them come near, then let them speak;<br>
Let us come near together for judgment. <br>
2 	&ldquo;Who raised up one from the east?<br>
Who in righteousness called him to His feet?<br>
Who gave the nations before him,<br>
And made him rule over kings?<br>
Who gave them as the dust to his sword,<br>
As driven stubble to his bow? <br>
3 	Who pursued them, and passed safely<br>
By the way that he had not gone with his feet? <br>
4 	Who has performed and done it,<br>
Calling the generations from the beginning?<br>
&ldquo;I, the LORD, am the first;<br>
And with the last I am He.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
5 	The coastlands saw it and feared,<br>
The ends of the earth were afraid;<br>

6 	Everyone helped his neighbor,<br>

Be not dismayed, for I am your God.<br>
I will strengthen you,<br>
Yes, I will help you,<br>
I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.&rsquo; <br>
11 	&ldquo;Behold, all those who were incensed against you<br>
Shall be ashamed and disgraced;<br>

12 	You shall seek them and not find them&mdash;<br>
Those who contended with you.<br>
Those who war against you<br>
Shall be as nothing,<br>
As a nonexistent thing. <br>
13 	For I, the LORD your God, will hold your right hand,<br>
Saying to you, &ldquo;Fear not, I will help you.&rsquo; <br>
14 	&ldquo;Fear not, you worm Jacob,<br>
You men of Israel!<br>
I will help you,&rdquo; says the LORD<br>
And your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. <br>
15 	&ldquo;Behold, I will make you into a new threshing sledge with sharp teeth;<br>
You shall thresh the mountains and beat them small,<br>
And make the hills like chaff. <br>
16 You shall winnow them, the wind shall carry them away,<br>
And the whirlwind shall scatter them;<br>
You shall rejoice in the LORD,<br>
And glory in the Holy One of Israel. <br>
17 	&ldquo;The poor and needy seek water, but there is none,<br>
Their tongues fail for thirst.<br>
I, the LORD, will hear them;<br>
I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. <br>
18 	I will open rivers in desolate heights,<br>
And fountains in the midst of the valleys;<br>
I will make the wilderness a pool of water,<br>
And the dry land springs of water. <br>
19 	I will plant in the wilderness the cedar and the acacia tree,<br>
The myrtle and the oil tree;<br>
I will set in the desert the cypress tree and the pine<br>
And the box tree together, <br>
20 	That they may see and know,<br>
And consider and understand together,<br>
That the hand of the LORD has done this,<br>
And the Holy One of Israel has created it. <br>
21 	&ldquo;Present your case,&rdquo; says the LORD.<br>
&ldquo;Bring forth your strong reasons,&rdquo; says the King of Jacob. <br>
22 	&ldquo;Let them bring forth and show us what will happen;<br>
Let them show the former things, what they were,<br>
That we may consider them,<br>
And know the latter end of them;<br>
Or declare to us things to come. <br>
23 	Show the things that are to come hereafter,<br>
That we may know that you are gods;<br>
Yes, do good or do evil,<br>
That we may be dismayed and see it together. <br>
24 	Indeed you are nothing,<br>
And your work is nothing;<br>
He who chooses you is an abomination. <br>
25 	&ldquo;I have raised up one from the north,<br>
And he shall come;<br>
From the rising of the sun he shall call on My name;<br>
And he shall come against princes as though mortar,<br>
As the potter treads clay. <br>
26 	Who has declared from the beginning, that we may know?<br>
And former times, that we may say, &ldquo;He is righteous&rsquo;?<br>
Surely there is no one who shows,<br>
Surely there is no one who declares,<br>
Surely there is no one who hears your words. <br>
27 	The first time I said to Zion,<br>
&ldquo;Look, there they are!&rsquo;<br>
And I will give to Jerusalem one who brings good tidings. <br>
28 	For I looked, and there was no man;<br>
I looked among them, but there was no counselor,<br>
Who, when I asked of them, could answer a word. <br>
29 	Indeed they are all worthless;<br>
Their works are nothing;<br>
Their molded images are wind and confusion. </font></p>

	<p><b>Isaiah is prophesying events that are future to him by a couple of centuries, the judgment on the nations; </b>there is no protection for them from the conqueror in verses 1-4. This is not bad news for Israel though; although he is not Jewish, this conqueror is righteous. At the time of writing, the nations surrounding Isaiah, including Israel and Judah (except Jerusalem), had been conquered by the Assyrians. Isaiah had already prophesied that Jerusalem would not fall to the Assyrians (<a href="10-2.html#Done" title="Isaiah 39 Summary" target="_blank">Isaiah 39:6-7, see notes</a>). This chapter steps past these events and looks to the conquering efforts of the Babylonian Empire which flourished from 626 B.C. until 539 B.C. - not very long as empires go. <strong>Cyrus, of Persia, overtook the Babylonians in 538 B.C.</strong> </p>
		<p>There's a reference to Cyrus in verse 2 as &quot;one from the east.&quot; While the Assyrians and Babylonians deported the Jews to distant lands, they began to return and rebuild under the Persians (around 535 B.C.). To substantiate that Isaiah is looking forward two Empires here (over 150 years), we will see in <a title="Isaiah 44 Summary" href="12-14.html#Top" title="Ezra 1 Summary" target="_blank">Ezra 1 (see notes)</a>.</p>

2 	He will not cry out, nor raise His voice,<br>
Nor cause His voice to be heard in the street. <br>
3 	A bruised reed He will not break,<br>
And smoking flax He will not quench;<br>

Now I will cry like a woman in labor,<br>
I will pant and gasp at once. <br>
15 	I will lay waste the mountains and hills,<br>
And dry up all their vegetation;<br>
I will make the rivers coastlands,<br>
And I will dry up the pools. <br>
16 	I will bring the blind by a way they did not know;<br>
I will lead them in paths they have not known.<br>
I will make darkness light before them,<br>

And through the rivers, they shall not overflow you.<br>
When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned,<br>
Nor shall the flame scorch you. <br>
3 	For I am the LORD your God,<br>
The Holy One of Israel, your Savior;<br>
I gave Egypt for your ransom,<br>
Ethiopia and Seba in your place. <br>
4 	Since you were precious in My sight,<br>
You have been honored,<br>
And I have loved you;<br>
Therefore I will give men for you,<br>
And people for your life. <br>
5 	Fear not, for I am with you;<br>
I will bring your descendants from the east,<br>
And gather you from the west; <br>
6 	I will say to the north, &ldquo;Give them up!&rsquo;<br>
And to the south, &lsquo;Do not keep them back!&rsquo;<br>
Bring My sons from afar,<br>
And My daughters from the ends of the earth&mdash; <br>
7 	Everyone who is called by My name,<br>
Whom I have created for My glory;<br>
I have formed him, yes, I have made him.&rdquo; <br>
8 	Bring out the blind people who have eyes,<br>
And the deaf who have ears. <br>
9 	Let all the nations be gathered together,<br>
And let the people be assembled.<br>
Who among them can declare this,<br>
And show us former things?<br>
Let them bring out their witnesses, that they may be justified;<br>
Or let them hear and say, &ldquo;It is truth.&rdquo; <br>
10 	&ldquo;You are My witnesses,&rdquo; says the LORD,<br>
&ldquo;And My servant whom I have chosen,<br>
That you may know and believe Me,<br>
And understand that I am He.<br>
Before Me there was no God formed,<br>
Nor shall there be after Me. <br>
11 	I, even I, am the LORD,<br>
And besides Me there is no savior. <br>
12 	I have declared and saved,<br>
I have proclaimed,<br>
And there was no foreign god among you;<br>
Therefore you are My witnesses,&rdquo;<br>
Says the LORD, &ldquo;that I am God. <br>
13 	Indeed before the day was, I am He;<br>
And there is no one who can deliver out of My hand;<br>
I work, and who will reverse it?&rdquo; <br>
14 	Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer,<br>
The Holy One of Israel:<br>
&ldquo;For your sake I will send to Babylon,<br>
And bring them all down as fugitives&mdash;<br>
The Chaldeans, who rejoice in their ships. <br>
15 I am the LORD, your Holy One,<br>
The Creator of Israel, your King.&rdquo; <br>
16 	Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea<br>
And a path through the mighty waters, <br>
17 	Who brings forth the chariot and horse,<br>
The army and the power<br>
(They shall lie down together, they shall not rise;<br>
They are extinguished, they are quenched like a wick): <br>
18 	&ldquo;Do not remember the former things,<br>
Nor consider the things of old. <br>
19 	Behold, I will do a new thing,<br>
Now it shall spring forth;<br>
Shall you not know it?<br>
I will even make a road in the wilderness<br>
And rivers in the desert. <br>
20 	The beast of the field will honor Me,<br>
The jackals and the ostriches,<br>
Because I give waters in the wilderness<br>
And rivers in the desert,<br>
To give drink to My people, My chosen. <br>
21 	This people I have formed for Myself;<br>
They shall declare My praise. <br>
22 	&ldquo;But you have not called upon Me, O Jacob;<br>
And you have been weary of Me, O Israel. <br>
23 	You have not brought Me the sheep for your burnt offerings,<br>
Nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices.<br>
I have not caused you to serve with grain offerings,<br>
Nor wearied you with incense. <br>
24 	You have bought Me no sweet cane with money,<br>
Nor have you satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices;<br>
But you have burdened Me with your sins,<br>
You have wearied Me with your iniquities. <br>
25 	&ldquo;I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake;<br>
And I will not remember your sins. <br>
26 	Put Me in remembrance;<br>
Let us contend together;<br>
State your case, that you may be acquitted. <br>
27 	Your first father sinned,<br>
And your mediators have transgressed against Me. <br>
28 	Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary;<br>
I will give Jacob to the curse,<br>
And Israel to reproaches. </font></p>

<p>This is a continuation of Isaiah's prophecy concerning Israel's return to their land. As you will recall, they were deported to the modern-day Iraq area during the Assyrian captivity and later, Jerusalem to Babylonian captivity. This passage was written before the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="11-4.html#Jerusalem" title="II Kings 24-25 Summary" target="_blank">II Kings 24-25, see notes</a>), but has prophesied already the fall of Jerusalem and subsequent deportation of its inhabitants, and now is prophesying their return. </p>
<p>There was a return to the land under the Persian King Cyrus who began his reign in 538 B.C. (<a href="12-31.html#Top" target="_blank"><b>Revelation 20-22</b> (see notes)</a><b> that a gathering of the nations will take place; this seems compatible with verse 9 in this chapter, &quot;Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled.&quot;</b></p>
