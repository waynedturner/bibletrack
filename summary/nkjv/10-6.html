<p>Of course Israel's problem throughout their history was their continuous return to the worship of idols and the strange gods they represented, despite the fact that this was a direct violation of the Law of Moses. Isaiah goes into detail regarding the process of building these idols in verses 10-14, apparently to point out the great care and workmanship required to produce them. Just as Moses didn't buy Aaron's story that he threw the gold into the fire and a calf came out, so does the process of verse 10-14 demonstrate that a cooperative effort on behalf of craftsmen brought the actual idols to the people.</p>
<p><b> Is it the epitome of stupidity or is it the epitome of rebellion against God himself that they could not lay off their idol worship for any extended period of time?</b> Even in Babylonian captivity, God warns them of this pitfall. Let's face it, sin is sin. All God ever wanted from man is captured in what observant Jews know as the Shema found in <a title="Deuteronomy 6 Summary" href="5-9.html#Commandment" target="_blank"><b>Matthew 22:37</b> (see notes)</a><b>, &quot;You shall love the LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND&quot;</b> When one has that relationship with God, everything else properly falls into place.</p>
	<p><strong>These verses describe in great detail the idolatrous practices of the Jewish people. No one could have accused Isaiah of not clearly stating his case here.</strong></p>
	<p><a name="Cyrus"></a><font size="4"><b>Cyrus will bring you back (Isaiah 44:21-28)</b></font><br>

I have formed you, you are My servant;<br>
O Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me! <br>
22 	I have blotted out, like a thick cloud, your transgressions,<br>
And like a cloud, your sins.<br>
Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.&rdquo; <br>
23 	Sing, O heavens, for the LORD has done it!<br>
Shout, you lower parts of the earth;<br>
Break forth into singing, you mountains,<br>
O forest, and every tree in it!<br>
For the LORD has redeemed Jacob,<br>
And glorified Himself in Israel. <br>

And He who formed you from the womb:<br>
&ldquo;I am the LORD, who makes all things,<br>

Who turns wise men backward,<br>

26 	Who confirms the word of His servant,<br>
And performs the counsel of His messengers;<br>
Who says to Jerusalem, &ldquo;You shall be inhabited,&rsquo;<br>
To the cities of Judah, &lsquo;You shall be built,&rsquo;<br>

	<p>God will forgive Israel and restore them - the message of these verses before Isaiah drops a very heavy prophecy on them in verse 28 regarding Cyrus. This Persian king, Cyrus, is mentioned here over 150 years before he would even be known to the Israelites. He's the king who would one day facilitate their return from exile.</p>
	<p><b>To properly appreciate this prophecy of Isaiah, consider the following dates of occurrences:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Isaiah's prophecy (approximately 700 B.C.)<br>
				The Assyrians rule the region.<br>
				Israel has fallen and much of Judah as well; many Jews were deported; Jerusalem remains unconquered.<br>
				Isaiah prophesied previously that Jerusalem would not fall to the Assyrians (<a href="10-2.html#Hezekiah" title="Isaiah 37 Summary" target="_blank">Isaiah 37:7-10, see notes</a>).<br>
				Isaiah prophesied (<a title="Isaiah 39 Summary" href="10-3.html#Done" target="_blank">Isaiah 39, see notes</a>) that Jerusalem would fall to the not-yet-an-empire Babylonians.
		  <li>The Babylonians conquered the Assyrians in 626 B.C.
			<li>Jerusalem was under siege, first by the Egyptians, then by the Babylonians from 609 B.C.; many more were deported (<a href="11-4.html#Jerusalem" title="II Kings 24-25 Summary" target="_blank">II Kings 24-25, see notes</a>).<br>
				Jerusalem was ruled by puppet kings of Egypt, then Babylon from 609 B.C. until their complete fall.
			<li>After Judah's King Zedekiah rebelled against Babylon, Jerusalem was overcome in 586 B.C. bringing to a close the Southern Kingdom of Judah; more Jews were deported (<a href="11-4.html#Jerusalem" title="II Kings 24-25 Summary" target="_blank">II Kings 24-25, see notes</a>).
			<li>Babylon falls to the Persians 539 B.C.
			<li>The Persian King Cyrus issues a decree for the Jews to return to Israel sometime after 538 B.C., over 150 years after Isaiah mentions him by name.<li>The Jews return to their homeland around 535 B.C.
		      <a href="12-14.html#Top" title="Ezra 1 Summary" target="_blank">Ezra 1 (see notes)</a>.
	    </ul>
	<p>Incidentally, the mention of Cyrus in verse 28 here and again in chapter 45 is used by liberal scholars to insist that, beginning with chapter 40, this portion of Isaiah was written much later...and not by Isaiah. On the other hand, I persist in the integrity of scripture and believe that Isaiah was the author of the entire Book of Isaiah. God gave him this prophecy regarding Cyrus over 150 years before he came on the scene.</p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>More about Cyrus (Isaiah 45:1-4)</b></font><br>
    </p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;Thus says the LORD to His anointed,<br>
To Cyrus, whose right hand I have held&mdash;<br>
To subdue nations before him<br>
And loose the armor of kings,<br>
To open before him the double doors,<br>
So that the gates will not be shut: <br>
2 	&ldquo;I will go before you<br>
And make the crooked places straight;<br>
I will break in pieces the gates of bronze<br>
And cut the bars of iron. <br>
3 	I will give you the treasures of darkness<br>
And hidden riches of secret places,<br>
That you may know that I, the LORD,<br>
Who call you by your name,<br>
Am the God of Israel. <br>
4 	For Jacob My servant&rsquo;s sake,<br>
And Israel My elect,<br>
I have even called you by your name;<br>
I have named you, though you have not known Me. <br>
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>This prophetic subject continues from chapter 44. Remember, <b>Isaiah is writing this prophecy before the Babylonians were to even overthrow the Assyrians.</b> Jerusalem has just been delivered from the conquering Assyrians, as we saw in <a title="Jerusalem Siege Summary" href="12-21.html#Top" target="_blank">Esther 1-5 (see notes)</a> regarding Cyrus and Persia.</p>
	<p><b>Verse 1 has a startling prophecy regarding King Cyrus,</b> &quot;Thus says the LORD to His anointed, 	To Cyrus, whose right hand I have held&mdash; 	To subdue nations before him&hellip;&quot; He was first mentioned, but not by name, in <a href="8-26.html#Run" target="_blank">I Kings 19:15-16 (see notes)</a> regarding the King in Damascus. The context in which the word &quot;anointed&quot; is used here is that he is appointed by God for the purpose of bringing the Jews back to their homeland from Babylonian exile. God even uses non believers to impact his people. A universal appeal to turn to God dominates the last half of this chapter.</p>
	<p><strong>In 1879 a clay tablet was discovered which now resides at the British Museum. In this tablet, Cyrus' allegiance to the god, Marduk, is clearly stated. So, here was an instrument of God who facilitated the Jews' return to their homeland in the name of human rights, but without an allegiance to the one true God.</strong></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>The sovereignty of God seen in the choice of Cyrus (Isaiah 45:5-13)</b></font><br>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">5 I am the LORD, and there is no other;<br>

That there is none besides Me.<br>
I am the LORD, and there is no other; <br>
7 	I form the light and create darkness,<br>
I make peace and create calamity;<br>
I, the LORD, do all these things.&rsquo; <br>
8 	&ldquo;Rain down, you heavens, from above,<br>

I, the LORD, have created it. <br>
9 	&ldquo;Woe to him who strives with his Maker!<br>

Or shall your handiwork say, &lsquo;He has no hands&rsquo;? <br>
10 	Woe to him who says to his father, &ldquo;What are you begetting?&rsquo;<br>
Or to the woman, &lsquo;What have you brought forth?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
11 	Thus says the LORD,<br>
The Holy One of Israel, and his Maker:<br>
&ldquo;Ask Me of things to come concerning My sons;<br>
And concerning the work of My hands, you command Me. <br>
12 	I have made the earth,<br>
And created man on it.<br>
I&mdash;My hands&mdash;stretched out the heavens,<br>
And all their host I have commanded. <br>
13 	I have raised him up in righteousness,<br>
And I will direct all his ways;<br>
He shall build My city<br>
And let My exiles go free,<br>
Not for price nor reward,&rdquo;<br>
Says the LORD of hosts. <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isaiah's prophecy transitions from specifics about Cyrus to God's sovereignty and his ability to use whom he likes to impact his people, the Jews. The essence of these verses is captured regarding Cyrus in verse 13, &quot;'I have raised him up in righteousness, And I will direct all his ways; He shall build My city And let My exiles go free, Not for price nor reward,' Says the LORD of hosts.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Millennium"></a>Looking to the Millennium (Isaiah 45:14-25)</b></font><br>

<p>This chapter concludes with a word about the Gentile submission that one day will take effect. These verses must be looking toward the millennium itself in light of Isaiah 45:17, &quot;But Israel shall be saved by the LORD 	With an everlasting salvation; 	You shall not be ashamed or disgraced 	Forever and ever.&quot; Not only so, but we see an invitation that extends to Gentiles as well in verse 22, &quot;Look to Me, and be saved, 	<strong>All you ends of the earth!</strong> 	For I am God, and there is no other.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Here's the message again: Stay away from those idols! (Isaiah 46)</b></font><br>

<p>As we said, Israel always had a problem with idolatry. In verse 1, Bel is the Aramaic form of Baal, the national god of the Babylonians, and Nebo was a Chaldean god whose worship had been introduced into Assyria. Isaiah makes an appeal to them regarding the ungodly practice of idolatry in this chapter again. Notice the question posed to Israel by God in verse 5, &quot;To whom will you liken Me, and make Me equal And compare Me, that we should be alike?&quot; He challenges them to look to God where true salvation is. Notice Isaiah's call back to their roots in verse 9, &quot;Remember the former things of old, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like Me.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;Come down and sit in the dust,<br>
O virgin daughter of Babylon;<br>
Sit on the ground without a throne,<br>
O daughter of the Chaldeans!<br>
For you shall no more be called<br>
Tender and delicate. <br>
2 	Take the millstones and grind meal.<br>
Remove your veil,<br>
Take off the skirt,<br>
Uncover the thigh,<br>
Pass through the rivers. <br>
3 	Your nakedness shall be uncovered,<br>
Yes, your shame will be seen;<br>
I will take vengeance,<br>
And I will not arbitrate with a man.&rdquo; <br>
4 	As for our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is His name,<br>
The Holy One of Israel. <br>
5 	&ldquo;Sit in silence, and go into darkness,<br>
O daughter of the Chaldeans;<br>
For you shall no longer be called<br>
The Lady of Kingdoms. <br>
6 	I was angry with My people;<br>
I have profaned My inheritance,<br>
And given them into your hand.<br>
You showed them no mercy;<br>
On the elderly you laid your yoke very heavily. <br>
7 	And you said, &ldquo;I shall be a lady forever,&rsquo;<br>
So that you did not take these things to heart,<br>
Nor remember the latter end of them. <br>
8 	&ldquo;Therefore hear this now, you who are given to pleasures,<br>
Who dwell securely,<br>
Who say in your heart, &lsquo;I am, and there is no one else besides me;<br>
I shall not sit as a widow,<br>
Nor shall I know the loss of children&rsquo;; <br>
9 	But these two things shall come to you<br>
In a moment, in one day:<br>
The loss of children, and widowhood.<br>
They shall come upon you in their fullness<br>
Because of the multitude of your sorceries,<br>
For the great abundance of your enchantments. <br>
10 	&ldquo;For you have trusted in your wickedness;<br>
You have said, &ldquo;No one sees me&rsquo;;<br>
Your wisdom and your knowledge have warped you;<br>
And you have said in your heart,<br>
&lsquo;I am, and there is no one else besides me.&rsquo; <br>
11 	Therefore evil shall come upon you;<br>
You shall not know from where it arises.<br>
And trouble shall fall upon you;<br>
You will not be able to put it off.<br>
And desolation shall come upon you suddenly,<br>
Which you shall not know. <br>
12 	&ldquo;Stand now with your enchantments<br>
And the multitude of your sorceries,<br>
In which you have labored from your youth&mdash;<br>
Perhaps you will be able to profit,<br>
Perhaps you will prevail. <br>
13 	You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels;<br>
Let now the astrologers, the stargazers,<br>
And the monthly prognosticators<br>
Stand up and save you<br>
From what shall come upon you. <br>
14 	Behold, they shall be as stubble,<br>
The fire shall burn them;<br>
They shall not deliver themselves<br>
From the power of the flame;<br>
It shall not be a coal to be warmed by,<br>
Nor a fire to sit before! <br>
15 	Thus shall they be to you<br>
With whom you have labored,<br>
Your merchants from your youth;<br>
They shall wander each one to his quarter.<br>
No one shall save you. </font></p>

<p>Even though Babylon is only a vassal state under the Assyrians at the time of Isaiah's writing, he prophesies the destruction of the Babylonian Empire - their fall to the Persians under King Cyrus in 538 B.C. Isaiah addresses the Babylonian Empire in verse 1 when he cries, &quot;O virgin daughter of Babylon.&quot; This whole chapter is all about their future fall; notice the phrases in the following verses:</p>
<blockquote>
			<p>Isaiah 47:3 <strong>Your nakedness shall be uncovered</strong>, 	Yes, your shame will be seen; 	<strong>I will take vengeance</strong>, 	And I will not arbitrate with a man.<br>
				Isaiah 47:9 <b>But these two things shall come to you 	In a moment, in one day: 	The loss of children, and widowhood.</b><br>
				Isaiah 47:11 <strong>Therefore evil shall come upon you</strong>; 	You shall not know from where it arises. 	And <strong>trouble shall fall upon you</strong>; 	You will not be able to put it off. 	And <strong>desolation shall come upon you suddenly</strong>, 	Which you shall not know. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>And then...there's your bright spot in verse 4, &quot;As for our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is His name, 	The Holy One of Israel.&quot; Although Babylon will conquer the Assyrians and rise to the top, they aren't to stay on top. Total destruction of the Babylonian Empire is in their future.</p>

		  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;Hear this, O house of Jacob,<br>
Who are called by the name of Israel,<br>
And have come forth from the wellsprings of Judah;<br>
Who swear by the name of the LORD,<br>
And make mention of the God of Israel,<br>
But not in truth or in righteousness; <br>
2 	For they call themselves after the holy city,<br>
And lean on the God of Israel;<br>
The LORD of hosts is His name: <br>
3 	&ldquo;I have declared the former things from the beginning;<br>
They went forth from My mouth, and I caused them to hear it.<br>
Suddenly I did them, and they came to pass. <br>
4 	Because I knew that you were obstinate,<br>
And your neck was an iron sinew,<br>
And your brow bronze, <br>
5 	Even from the beginning I have declared it to you;<br>
Before it came to pass I proclaimed it to you,<br>
Lest you should say, &ldquo;My idol has done them,<br>
And my carved image and my molded image<br>
Have commanded them.&rsquo; <br>
6 	&ldquo;You have heard;<br>
See all this.<br>
And will you not declare it?<br>
I have made you hear new things from this time,<br>
Even hidden things, and you did not know them. <br>
7 	They are created now and not from the beginning;<br>
And before this day you have not heard them,<br>
Lest you should say, &ldquo;Of course I knew them.&rsquo; <br>
8 	Surely you did not hear,<br>
Surely you did not know;<br>
Surely from long ago your ear was not opened.<br>
For I knew that you would deal very treacherously,<br>
And were called a transgressor from the womb. <br>
9 	&ldquo;For My name&rsquo;s sake I will defer My anger,<br>
And for My praise I will restrain it from you,<br>
So that I do not cut you off. <br>
10 	Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver;<br>
I have tested you in the furnace of affliction. <br>
11 	For My own sake, for My own sake, I will do it;<br>
For how should My name be profaned?<br>
And I will not give My glory to another. <br>
12 	&ldquo;Listen to Me, O Jacob,<br>
And Israel, My called:<br>
I am He, I am the First,<br>
I am also the Last. <br>
13 	Indeed My hand has laid the foundation of the earth,<br>
And My right hand has stretched out the heavens;<br>
When I call to them,<br>
They stand up together. <br>
14 	&ldquo;All of you, assemble yourselves, and hear!<br>
Who among them has declared these things?<br>
The LORD loves him;<br>
He shall do His pleasure on Babylon,<br>
And His arm shall be against the Chaldeans. <br>
15 	I, even I, have spoken;<br>
Yes, I have called him,<br>
I have brought him, and his way will prosper. <br>
16 	&ldquo;Come near to Me, hear this:<br>
I have not spoken in secret from the beginning;<br>
From the time that it was, I was there.<br>
And now the Lord GOD and His Spirit<br>
Have sent Me.&rdquo; <br>
17 	Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer,<br>
The Holy One of Israel:<br>
&ldquo;I am the LORD your God,<br>
Who teaches you to profit,<br>
Who leads you by the way you should go. <br>
18 	Oh, that you had heeded My commandments!<br>
Then your peace would have been like a river,<br>
And your righteousness like the waves of the sea. <br>
19 	Your descendants also would have been like the sand,<br>
And the offspring of your body like the grains of sand;<br>
His name would not have been cut off<br>
Nor destroyed from before Me.&rdquo; <br>
20 	Go forth from Babylon!<br>
Flee from the Chaldeans!<br>
With a voice of singing,<br>
Declare, proclaim this,<br>
Utter it to the end of the earth;<br>
Say, &ldquo;The LORD has redeemed<br>
His servant Jacob!&rdquo; <br>
21 	And they did not thirst<br>
When He led them through the deserts;<br>
He caused the waters to flow from the rock for them;<br>
He also split the rock, and the waters gushed out. <br>
22 	&ldquo;There is no peace,&rdquo; says the LORD, &ldquo;for the wicked.&rdquo; </font></p>

	<p>Through Isaiah, God exhorts Israel/Judah to turn to God. The time will come under Cyrus when they will return to their homeland (after 538 B.C.), and they need to be spiritually prepared for that occasion. They need to have learned their lesson about serving and loving the only true God. <b>Israel knew from </b><a title="Deuteronomy 30 Summary" href="4-17.html#Falling" target="_blank"><b>Deuteronomy 30:1-5</b> (see notes)</a><b> that it was prophesied before they even occupied Canaan in the first place that their rejection of God would result in their captivity.</b> Isaiah writes regarding the history of obstinate practice by Israel toward God in verses 4-8. So where do we go from here? There's your answer in verse 9, &quot;For My name&rsquo;s sake I will defer My anger, 	And for My praise I will restrain it from you, 	So that I do not cut you off.&quot; God will deliver Israel because God keeps his promises - even when they don't. So...when Israel failed to keep their end of the bargain with God, what did God do about it? Notice verse 10, &quot;Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; 	I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.&quot; God will keep his promises to Israel, but not without affliction for their wrongdoing. God will destroy Babylon, the future (at that time) conquerors of Jerusalem.</p>
