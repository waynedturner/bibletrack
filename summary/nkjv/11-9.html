<p><font size="4"><b>An introduction to Hebrews<br>
				</b></font><font size="3"><b>Who wrote Hebrews? </b></font>I'm relatively comfortable with the notion that Hebrews was written by Paul, not Luke, Apollos or Barnabas. He was an expert on Jewish law, having been a Pharisee, and so was the author of this book. Paul was passionate about showing the Jews that keeping the law was an old-covenant concept, but Christ fulfilled those requirements. That's what the Book of Hebrews is all about. </p>
		<p>Some have argued that the style of writing is not Paul's; Hebrews is a more formal writing style. However, the audience for the Book of Hebrews calls for a more treatise-like document than a personal letter to churches like Paul's other epistles. One's writing style often changes for the situation. If I were writing a technical, formal paper, the writing style of that paper would look nothing like my informal notes found on BibleTrack. </p>
		<p>Another indicator used to dispute Pauline authorship is the lack of a personal greeting found at the beginning of his other letters. My reply is the same; Hebrews is a different kind of a document than those letters. One more evidence commonly used by those who feel that Paul did not write the Book of Hebrews is the wording of <a href="8-5.html#Caesar" title="Acts 25 Summary" target="_blank">Acts 25 (see notes)</a>.Therefore, I'm sticking with Paul on this one. I'm not adamant about it, but you will see in my commentary notes here a frequent reference to Paul's authorship.</p>
	<p> Since the Jewish sacrificial system still seems to be intact at the time of the writing of Hebrews, it seems obvious that it was written prior to the destruction of the temple in 70 A.D. <b>The epistle was written to Jewish Believers who were still struggling with keeping the law after receiving Christ as Savior.</b> So, here's a cute and very helpful quote that will help you remember the purpose of this book: <b>&quot;Hebrews was written to the Hebrews to tell the Hebrews to stop being Hebrews.&quot;</b> I picked up that helpful explanatory phrase from Dr. Gordon Carpenter back in 1970 when he was President of Florida Bible Institute in Mims, Florida. In other words, the Book of Hebrews was written to the Hebrew Christians to tell these Hebrew Christians to stop acting like Jews (Hebrews) and start acting like Christians. These Jewish Christians are being told here that they need to rest in the finished work of Christ and stop all of their Judaistic rituals which they are trusting for righteousness. And...incidentally...that mission seems very Pauline to me.</p>

    </blockquote>
	<p>So, for those Jewish Believers having difficulty characterizing Christ's position with regard to God, Paul clarifies it right here in the first three chapters. Chapter 1 is intended to dispel the impression that Christ was an angel. <b>HE WAS NOT AN ANGEL; HE WAS BETTER!</b> </p>
	<p>First of all, Paul frames the proposition in verses 1-3: Previously, God spoke to our Jewish fathers at various times and in various ways through prophets (verse 1). However, in these last days he spoke to us through his son, Jesus Christ (verse 2). Notice the exactness with which Paul describes Jesus in verse 3, &quot;who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.&quot; The Greek word for &quot;express image&quot; there is &quot;charakter.&quot; In other words, <b>Jesus is the bodily form of God.</b> As a matter of fact, I like to say it like this, &quot;Jesus is the only body God ever had.&quot; I'm convinced that every incarnation of God in the Bible was Jesus himself. </p>
	<p>Incidentally, to the orthodox Jew, this bodily incarnation of God (verse 3) is a paradigm contrary to what they have been taught; for them, it's a deal breaker. <b>However, </b><a title="Isaiah 9 Summary" href="9-16.html#Messiah" target="_blank"><b>Isaiah 9:6-7</b> (see notes)</a><b> is a highly-regarded Messianic prophecy, and Jewish scholars accept it as such; that passage calls for a Messiah who is an incarnation of very God when it says,</b> &quot;For unto us a Child is born, 	Unto us a Son is given; 	And the government will be upon His shoulder. 	And His name will be called 	Wonderful, Counselor, <strong>Mighty God, 	Everlasting Father</strong>, Prince of Peace. 	Of the increase of His government and peace 	There will be no end, 	Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, 	To order it and establish it with judgment and justice 	From that time forward, even forever. 	The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.&quot; There can be no other conclusion drawn but that verse 3 is intended to portray the unique incarnate deity of the Messiah per the specifications of Isaiah, and Isaiah's Messiah just happens to be Jesus Christ.</p>
	<p>In verse 4, the better-than-angels argument is introduced with regard to Jesus. The argument begins with the issue of inheritance, &quot;having become so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.&quot; That's a rather simple statement based upon the Messianic attributes of Isaiah 9:6-7; Christ has a different purpose than angels - by inheritance. </p>
	<p>Paul's refutation style here is an academic, logical approach to the supernatural identity of Christ. <strong>From verses 5-13 he quotes from several Psalms that were regarded by the Jews to be Messianic to demonstrate that the work of Jesus on the cross was a fulfillment of the Messianic prophecies as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
			<li>Verse 5 - For to which of the angels did He ever say: 	&ldquo;You are My Son, 	Today I have begotten You&rdquo;?<br>
				A quote from <a title="Psalm 2 Summary" href="6-16.html#Messianic" target="_blank">Psalm 2:7 (see notes)</a>.<br>
				Incidentally, Paul also quoted this exact Psalm 2:7 in his message found in <a title="Acts 13 Summary" href="7-20.html#Continues" target="_blank">Acts 13:32-33 (see notes)</a>.
			<li>Verse 5 - And again: 	&ldquo;I will be to Him a Father, 	And He shall be to Me a Son&rdquo;?<br>
				A quote from <a title="II Samuel 7 Summary" href="6-19.html#Temple" target="_blank">II Samuel 7:14 (see notes)</a>. That's the Davidic Covenant passage of scripture with special Messianic significance to the Jews.
			<li>Verse 6 - But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: 	&ldquo;Let all the angels of God worship Him.&rdquo;<br>
				A near quote of the Septuagint phrase found in Psalm 97:7.
<li>Verse 7 - And of the angels He says: 	&ldquo;Who makes His angels spirits 	And His ministers a flame of fire.&rdquo;<br>
				A quote from <a title="Psalm 104 Summary" href="6-9.html#Bless" target="_blank">Psalm 104:4 (see notes)</a>.
			<li>Verses 8-9 - But to the Son He says: 	&ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; 	A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; 	Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You 	With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.&rdquo;<br>
				A quotation from <a title="Psalm 45 Summary" href="6-1.html#Song" target="_blank">Psalm 45:6-7 (see notes)</a>.
			<li>Verses 10-12 - And: 	&ldquo;You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, 	And the heavens are the work of Your hands. They will perish, but You remain; 	And they will all grow old like a garment; Like a cloak You will fold them up, 	And they will be changed. 	But You are the same, 	And Your years will not fail.&rdquo;<br>
				A quotation from <a title="Psalm 102 Summary" href="6-9.html#Prayer" target="_blank">Psalm 102:25-27 (see notes)</a>.
			<li>Verse 13 - But to which of the angels has He ever said: 	&ldquo;Sit at My right hand, 	Till I make Your enemies Your footstool&rdquo;? <br>
				A quotation of <a title="Psalm 110 Summary" href="7-11.html#Messianic" target="_blank">Psalm 110:1 (see notes)</a>. You will notice from the notes on Psalm 110 that Paul makes extensive use of this Messianic Psalm in his epistles, another strong argument for Pauline authorship.
		</ul>
	<p>As you can see from these quotations, Paul links Jesus to the <a title="The Davidic Covenant" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Davidic_Covenant.html" target="_blank">Davidic Covenant (see article)</a> with these quotations.</p>
		<p>Now it's back to the comparison of Christ to angels, the discussion that began in verse 4. These quotations serve to demonstrate that Jesus is the promised Messiah of the Old Testament; angels serve to testify to Christ as he says in verse 14, &quot;Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation?&quot; In other words, angels are &quot;ministering spirits&quot; and not sacrificial lambs.</p>
<p><a name="Reliable"></a><font size="4"><b>If you thought the angels were reliable... (Hebrews 2:1-4)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away. <br>
		    2 For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just reward, <br>
		    3 how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him,<br>
	      4 God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will? </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Verse 1 draws a conclusion based upon the proposition presented in chapter 1 when it says, &quot;Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away.&quot; Those &quot;things which we have heard&quot; undoubtedly refers to the doctrine of Jesus Christ as the Messiah. In the Jewish community there would be a lot of pressure to abandon that notion. The angels were true witnesses. Even greater is the witness of Jesus Christ who was validated by those indicators (verse 4) which followed his ministry. The evidence is undeniable; how can someone not be held accountable who rejects this presentation? In other words, as verse 3 expresses it, &quot;how shall we escape?&quot; Or...to put it bluntly - to ignore the Gospel message is to &quot;neglect so great a salvation.&quot;</p>
	<p>Some have used the wording of verses 2-3 to support their contention that someone other than Paul wrote Hebrews. They reason that the writer states in verse 3, &quot;...and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him.&quot; To them, that is in conflict with Paul's statements regarding the appearance of Jesus to him as in I Corinthians 15:8, &quot;Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.&quot; That seems like a very weak argument for determining that Hebrews could not have been written by Paul. He never claimed to have sat under the public ministry of Jesus; that's the context of verse 3. Paul's claim was that he received direct revelation from Jesus himself supernaturally. He goes on in verse 4 to validate the ministry of those early witnesses when he says, &quot;God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?&quot; This is an obvious reference to the activities after the Day of Pentecost of the apostles themselves.</p>
<p><a name="Angel"></a><font size="4"><b>But Jesus Christ was no angel (Hebrews 2:5-18)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">5 &para; For He has not put the world to come, of which we speak, in subjection to angels. <br>
		    6 But one testified in a certain place, saying:<br>
&ldquo;What is man that You are mindful of him,<br>
Or the son of man that You take care of him?<br>
7 	You have made him a little lower than the angels;<br>
You have crowned him with glory and honor,<br>
And set him over the works of Your hands.<br>
8 	You have put all things in subjection under his feet.&rdquo; For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him. But now we do not yet see all things put under him. <br>
9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone. <br>
10 &para; For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. <br>
11 For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren, <br>
12 saying:<br>
&ldquo;I will declare Your name to My brethren;<br>
In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.&rdquo;<br>
13 And again:<br>
&ldquo;I will put My trust in Him.&rdquo; And again:<br>
&ldquo;Here am I and the children whom God has given Me.&rdquo;<br>
14 &para; Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, <br>
15 and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. <br>
16 For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. <br>
17 Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. <br>
18 For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>The comparison to angels goes on. Angels are messengers of God. Jesus Christ was no mere angel, but rather the redeemer of mankind (verse 5). In verses 6-8 Paul quotes from <a title="Psalm 8 Summary" href="9-12.html#Fear" target="_blank">Isaiah 8:17-18 (see notes)</a> in verse 13. His point is this: Believers are united in Christ within the family of God as brethren. He continues (verse 14) by emphasizing that Jesus, by flesh and blood, might &quot;destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil.&quot; He clarifies that he's speaking of the devil. Therefore, Believers are delivered from this death (verse 15). It is not clear what is meant in verse 16, &quot;For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham.&quot; The Greek verb for &quot;give aid to&quot; here is &quot;epilambanomai,&quot; which is translated &quot;took on&quot; in the KJV in this verse. As a matter of fact, of the 18 times this verb appears in the NKJV, it is translated &quot;aid&quot; only in this verse. Otherwise it is translated with the connotation of catching, taking hold or seizing in all other instances. For that reason, I'm more inclined to believe that Paul is really speaking of the fact that Jesus took on the nature of a human rather than that of angels. His office as high priest is emphasized in verses 17 and 18. He took upon himself the form of a man to become our high priest - obviously better than angels. There's a promise in verse 18: Jesus overcame temptation and is therefore able to give us victory over temptation.</p>
<p><a name="Moses"></a><font size="4"><b>If you liked Moses, you'll really like Christ (Hebrews 3)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus, <br>
    2 who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house. <br>
    3 For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house. <br>
    4 For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God. <br>
    5 And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which would be spoken afterward,<br>
    6 but Christ as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end. <br>
    7 &para; Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:<br>
&ldquo;Today, if you will hear His voice,<br>
8 	Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,<br>
In the day of trial in the wilderness,<br>
9 	Where your fathers tested Me, tried Me,<br>
And saw My works forty years.<br>
10 	Therefore I was angry with that generation,<br>
And said, &ldquo;They always go astray in their heart,<br>
And they have not known My ways.&rsquo;<br>
11 	So I swore in My wrath,<br>
&ldquo;They shall not enter My rest.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;<br>
12 &para; Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; <br>
13 but exhort one another daily, while it is called &ldquo;Today,&rdquo; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.<br>
14 For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, <br>
15 while it is said:<br>
&ldquo;Today, if you will hear His voice,<br>
Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.&rdquo;<br>
16 &para; For who, having heard, rebelled? Indeed, was it not all who came out of Egypt, led by Moses? <br>
17 Now with whom was He angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness? <br>
18 And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey? <br>
19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course Moses was a hero of Judaism; all Jews had the highest regard for him. This chapter compares Moses to Christ. Moses was faithful over that which was entrusted to him (verse 2); Christ was faithful over that which was his as well (verses 3-6). The analogy there is that Moses was part of the creation of Christ/God, as are we (verse 6). That's based upon the proposition seen in the latter part of verse 6 that those Hebrews adhere to the premise that Jesus was the fulfillment of the Old Testament Messianic promises.</p>
<p>With that analogy introduced, beginning in verse 7, Paul brings up the rejection of God under the leadership of Moses and Aaron in the wilderness here that caused the Jews to wander for 40 years in the wilderness. When they left Egypt, the objective was to reach Canaan, their own land. Upon the return of the spies in <a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="3-21.html#People" target="_blank">Numbers 14 (see notes)</a>, it was decision time for Israel: Will you accept the promise of God, or will you reject the promise of God? When Israel rejected the promise, that generation of adult men was decreed to die in the wilderness and never reach the objective - rest in the land.</p>
<p>So, here's the analogy Paul is making in verses 7-12: Just as all of the Hebrews who left Egypt did not exercise the faith to the fulfillment of rest in the promised land, so are there Jews in Paul's day looking for the Messiah who reject Jesus Christ as the same. There is no partial credit for tagging along for a portion of the trip. The destination (faith in Christ) is the objective, just like Canaan was the objective out of Egypt. In other words, good, observant Jews who reject Jesus as the Messiah miss the reward just like those Hebrews that rejected moving into Canaan in <a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="3-21.html#People" target="_blank">Numbers 14 (see notes)</a>.</p>
	<p>We have a unique set of circumstances in the Book of Hebrews with regard to terminology. When Paul uses the word &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;brethren&quot; (Greek: &quot;adelphos&quot;), he may be referring to a blood relationship or a spiritual relationship. Since he, himself, was Jewish, he considered the Jewish people to be his &quot;brethren.&quot; However, when Paul uses the unique adjective &quot;holy&quot; (Greek: &quot;hagios&quot;) with &quot;brethren&quot; in verse 1, it would seem that he is emphasizing a spiritual relationship in Christ. However, in verse 12, it would appear that Paul is referring to his blood relationship (no adjective - &quot;holy&quot;).</p>
		<p>There is absolutely no question that verse 1 refers to Believers; Paul's description is clear - &quot;holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling&quot; accompanied with &quot;the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus.&quot; His reference to &quot;our&quot; confession obviously is meant to indicate their mutual faith in Christ with him. In verse 2 we see that Christ, as High Priest, was faithful just as Moses was faithful. Jesus is deserving of more honor than Moses (verse 3); Jesus, as the creator (established in chapter 1), is greater than Moses as one who was part of that creation (verses 4-5). </p>
		<p>Verse 6 needs some explanation, &quot;but Christ as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.&quot; It cannot be understood properly without a clear view of the analogy that follows. Verses 7-11 are comprised of a quotation from <a title="Psalm 95 Summary" href="3-21.html#People" target="_blank">Numbers 14 (see notes)</a> following the return of the spies from Canaan. So...here's the analogy: Just as many Hebrews started out on the journey to Canaan chose not to actually enter, so many of the Jews in Paul's day who started out in the journey of Judaism looking for the Messiah will stop short of accepting Jesus Christ as such. In other words, &quot;the end&quot; is faith in Christ. The Jewish people of Paul's day must receive Jesus as their Messiah as the completion of their quest for God. Thus, the &quot;brethren&quot; of verse 12 are Jewish people who decline to receive Jesus as their Messiah, constituting their &quot;departing from the living God.&quot;</p>
	<p>He continues in verse 13 with a a command that they should &quot;exhort&quot; one another to follow through with the natural end of Judaism, receiving Jesus as Messiah and not be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, as were the Numbers 14 rebels. In verse 14, the tense of the Greek verb &quot;ginomai,&quot; translated in the KJV &quot;we are made,&quot; is perfect active to indicate a completed rather than continuing relationship. In other words, &quot;we have become partakers&quot; (NKJV) captures the essence of what Paul is saying about those Jews who traveled the completed route from Judaism to receiving Jesus as the Messiah. In verse 15 he revisits the quote of verses 7-8 regarding those rebels in Numbers 14 who hardened their hearts. Paul uses the last 4 verses (16-19) to drive the implications of that story home. Those rebels of Numbers 14 lived for as many as 40 more years without the hope of entering the promised land because of their rejection of God on that fateful day when the spies gave their report. He concludes his remarks in verse 19 with, &quot;So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.&quot;</p>
		<p>In essence, Paul is saying, &quot;Don't let this happen to you!&quot; <b>The message of this chapter is: Do not let your sin keep you from obeying the truth like your forefathers did in the wilderness.</b> In other words, don't reject Christ like your forefathers rejected Moses.</p>

		  <p><font size="2">1 Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. <br>
		    2 For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it.<br>
		    3 For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said:<br>
&ldquo;So I swore in My wrath,<br>
&lsquo;They shall not enter My rest,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. <br>
4 For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: &ldquo;And God rested on the seventh day from all His works&rdquo;;<br>
5 and again in this place: &ldquo;They shall not enter My rest.&rdquo;<br>
6 &para; Since therefore it remains that some must enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience, <br>
7 again He designates a certain day, saying in David, &ldquo;Today,&rdquo; after such a long time, as it has been said:<br>
&ldquo;Today, if you will hear His voice,<br>
Do not harden your hearts.&rdquo;<br>
8 &para; For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day. <br>
9 There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. <br>
10 For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His. <br>
11 &para; Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. <br>
12 For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <br>
13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account. <br>
14 &para; Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. <br>
15 For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. <br>
16 Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>If it seemed to you that Paul explained that rebellion of <a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="7-9.html#Learn" target="_blank">Psalm 95:7-11 (see notes)</a> sufficiently, hang on; he's still not finished. He devotes 11 more verses in chapter 4 to make certain these Jews understand the point: JUST BEING JEWISH ISN'T ENOUGH!</p>
	<p>He actually emphasizes all the points of chapter 3 over again:</p>
	<ul>
      <li>Verse 1 - Don't fall short of the Messianic promise by declining Jesus as the Messiah.
      <li>Verse 2 - The mere hearing of the Gospel message is not effective for salvation and &quot;did not profit them, not being mixed with faith.&quot;
      <li>Verse 3 - &quot;For we who have believed do enter that rest.&quot; The Greek verb &quot;believed&quot; is in the aorist tense which indicates a point in time as opposed to continual action. In other words, having once &quot;believed&quot; secures ones &quot;rest.&quot; In this verse, Psalm 95:11 is once again quoted as it was in 3:11. The &quot;rest&quot; from the &quot;foundation of the world&quot; is meant to accentuate the role of faith as opposed to &quot;the works.&quot;
      <li>Verse 4 - A reinforcement of the concept of rest (as opposed to works) is seen by the usage of Genesis 2:2, &quot;And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.&quot;
      <li>Verse 5 - It's back to Psalm 95:11.
      <li>Verse 6 - Some entered into the rest, and some did not. That's a reference to those who accepted the evil report from the spies in Numbers 14.
      <li>Verses 7-9 - Paul again quotes Psalm 95:7-8 as he did in Hebrews 3:8 and 15, but to make a different point this time. Psalm 95 is intended to refer to spiritual rebellion and spiritual rest. The point is made that if Joshua (KJV renders it &quot;Jesus&quot;) had provided the final rest, then there would have been no need for David to reference the passage as he did in Psalm 95:7-11. Therefore, the people of God have rest from their works through faith in Christ.			
      <li>Verses 10-11 - Cease works (of Judaism); exercise faith (in Christ as Messiah); don't follow the example of the rebels in unbelief. Rest as God rested on the seventh day (verse 4).
    </ul>
	<p>We find in verse 12 my favorite scripture on the power of God's Word, &quot;For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.&quot; So...how do you get the rest and the belief of verses 1-11? It's by the exposure to God's Word. This Word of God is an offensive weapon in and of itself. Being a &quot;discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,&quot; verse 13 tells us that no one escapes being revealed by it. </p>
	<p>Finally, verses 14-16 present Jesus as our great high priest. He's heavenly, as opposed to the earthly Aaronic priesthood (verse 14). Though he was tempted to sin, he did not do so (verse 15). Therefore, Jesus is the high priest to whom all should go (verse 16). These verses regarding the high priesthood of Jesus lead into chapter 5.</p>
<p><a name="Priest"></a><font size="4"><b>So, how did Christ become a high priest? (Hebrews 5:1-10)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. <br>
		    2 He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness. <br>
		    3 Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins. <br>
		    4 And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was.<br>
		    5 &para; So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him:<br>
&ldquo;You are My Son,<br>
Today I have begotten You.&rdquo;<br>
6 &para; As He also says in another place:<br>
&ldquo;You are a priest forever<br>
According to the order of Melchizedek&rdquo;; <br>
7 who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear, <br>
8 though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. <br>
9 And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him, <br>
10 called by God as High Priest &ldquo;according to the order of Melchizedek,&rdquo;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><b>We begin this chapter with four verses that lay a foundation for the Aaronic priesthood:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Verse 1 - The high priest was taken from among men to offer sacrifices for sins.
      <li>Verse 2 - As a sinful man himself, he (the earthly priest) could identify with sinners.
      <li>Verse 3 - As a sinful man, he offered sacrifices for himself as well as the people.
      <li>Verse 4 - Like Aaron, a high priest was called by God.
    </ul>
    <p>That brings us to verses 5-6. <b>&quot;Melchizedek&quot; is the name to remember.</b> We first see reference to him in <a title="Genesis 14 Summary" href="11-13.html" target="_blank">Click here if you want to go ahead and read the notes on Melchizedek in Hebrews 7.</a></p>
    <p><b>Here are the points made regarding Jesus being our High Priest:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Verse 5 - God made Jesus our high priest. Paul quotes <a title="Psalm 2 Summary" href="6-16.html#Messianic" target="_blank">Psalms 2:7 (see notes)</a> to make this point, &quot;I will declare the decree: 	The LORD has said to Me, 	&lsquo;You are My Son, 	Today I have begotten You.&quot;
      <li>Verse 6 - Christ's priesthood is &quot;according to the order of Melchisedec,&quot; not Aaron. He quotes <a title="Psalm 110 Summary" href="7-11.html#Messianic" target="_blank">Psalm 110:4 (see notes)</a> to validate this premise.
      <li>Verse 7 - Christ interceded for us in the garden prior to his crucifixion (<a title="atthew 26:36-46; Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46; John 18:1 Summary" href="6-6.html#Jesus" target="_blank">Matthew 26:36-46; Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46; John 18:1, see notes</a>)
      <li>Verse 8 - He obeyed his calling by proceeding to the crucifixion to pay for the sins of mankind.
    </ul>
    <p>The two key verses here are 9-10: &quot;And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him, called by God as High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.&quot;<b> Jesus was perfect, the only provider of eternal salvation and our high priest. No lesser specifications of Jesus are acceptable. </b>These first 10 verses establish that Jesus is our high priest after an eternal priesthood established by God as opposed to the temporary priesthood of Aaron. At this point in the discussion, Paul takes a detour from the topic to discuss the spiritual state of the recipients of this letter.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>You people are so immature! (Hebrews 5:11-14)</b></font><br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">11 of whom we have much to say, and hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing. <br>
		    12 &para; For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food. <br>
		    13 For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. <br>
	      14 But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>As Paul begins to explain to these Hebrew Christians the concept of the priesthood of Melchizedek which he introduced in verses 1-10, he pauses to comment on how this doctrine is a little deep for his readers; they are &quot;dull of hearing&quot; (verse 11). While they ought to be capable teachers by now, instead they are in need of being taught again the basics - &quot;the first principles of the oracles of God.&quot; That's too bad too; they ought to be mature in the Lord by now, but they are like babies when it comes to doctrinal issues; they are in need of &quot;milk&quot; (elementary) doctrine before they can understand &quot;meat&quot; doctrine such as the priesthood of Melchizedek. Paul then interrupts his discourse on the priesthood of Melchizedek to deal with the issue of immature Believers; he'll pick Melchizedek back up in 6:19.</p>
<p><a name="Paul"></a><font size="4"><b>Paul deals with a major lack of understanding among Hebrew Christians (Hebrews 6:1-12)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Therefore, leaving the discussion of the elementary principles of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, <br>
    2 of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. <br>
    3 And this we will do if God permits. <br>
    4 &para; For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, <br>
    5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, <br>
    6 if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame. <br>
    7 &para; For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God; <br>
    8 but if it bears thorns and briers, it is rejected and near to being cursed, whose end is to be burned. <br>
    9 &para; But, beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, yes, things that accompany salvation, though we speak in this manner. <br>
    10 For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister. <br>
    11 And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end, <br>
  12 that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first 3 verses here Paul expresses concern that these immature Jewish Believers still had not mastered the elementary principles of the faith. He began this discussion in chapter 5 when in verse 13 he refers to them as &quot;babes&quot; in the faith. </p>
<p><b>What are these &quot;principles of the doctrine of Christ&quot; on which these Hebrew Christians seem to need a refresher</b> (verses 1-3)<b>?</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;repentance from dead works&quot;<br>
    They needed to turn from the works of Judaism.
    
  <li>&quot;faith toward God&quot;<br>
    They needed to turn to faith in Christ.
    
  <li>&quot;the doctrine of baptisms&quot;<br>
    They needed to understand the differences between the baptism of Jewish proselytes, baptism by John the Baptist, Christian baptism and Holy Spirit baptism.
    
  <li>&quot;laying on of hands&quot;<br>
    For commissioning, ordination, etc.
    
  <li>&quot;resurrection of the dead&quot;
    
  <li>&quot;eternal judgment&quot;
      </ul>
<p>You can see that these were some pretty basic issues of their Christian faith. A lack of understanding on these issues would open them up to false teachers. <b>Then Paul expresses a major concern he has for these Jewish Christians - their impression that the sacrifice of Christ on the cross can somehow be treated like the temporal sacrifices they were accustomed to making when they sinned.</b> Many have sought to deny that the people referenced here are actually saved, but I'm convinced that the five qualifications described in verses 4-5 are intended by Paul to absolutely confirm that he is talking about washed-in-the-blood Believers. </p>
<p><b>Let's look at these five qualifications that constitute a Believer in verses 4-5:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>once enlightened
  <li>have tasted of the heavenly gift
  <li>have become partakers of the Holy Spirit
  <li>have tasted the good word of God 
  <li>[have tasted] the powers of the age to come, 
  </ul>
<p>It appears that Paul is going the extra mile to make certain that his readers understand that he is talking about saved people in verses 4-5. So, what's the falling-away reference in verse 6? Here it is:<b> These Jewish Christians were accustomed to offering another sacrifice every time they sinned. The Christian life does not work like that. </b>Christ was just sacrificed one time; it can't happen again. Paul is explaining: that's it; there is no more sacrifice. So, for these Jews who wanted to continue with their Old Testament pattern of sinning, sacrificing, sinning, sacrificing, sinning, sacrificing...(you get the picture), there's only one sacrifice - Christ. <b>Therefore, they needed to understand: if you say that the sacrifice of Christ was only good until your next shortcoming (sin), you have a big problem - you're all out of sacrifices; Christ was only sacrificed once.</b> If you take the sacrifice of Christ and apply it to the old pattern of repeated sacrifices rather than accepting the new pattern of once-and-for-all sacrifice, you have no more sacrifice to offer, and thus, no way back to salvation. <b>This hypothetical scenario is intended to show the Jewish Christians that, were it possible to have a second salvation experience, it would require that they &quot;crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.&quot;</b> That, of course, is impossible. To sum it up, Paul is saying this: If you could lose your salvation (and you can't), you could not be saved again because you have used up the only sacrifice Christ made for salvation. They must abandon their old mindset of sin, sacrifice, sin again, sacrifice again in lieu of the finished work of Christ once and for all for all their sin.</p>
<p>Verses 7-9 reinforces the roll of good works in the Believer's life. He is blessed from God as he serves. Verse 8 probably paints a scenario of the Judgment Seat of Christ in <a title="I Corinthians 3 Summary" href="8-29.html#Rewards" target="_blank">I Corinthians 3:11-15 (see notes)</a> where Believers' works are tried by fire. Verse 15 of that passage says, &quot;f anyone&rsquo;s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.&quot; This second fire analogy adds additional evidence to my arsenal that Paul wrote Hebrews. In verse 9 Paul expresses that he expects godliness in lifestyle from these Hebrew Christians. Verses 10-12 sum up Paul's exhortation here: You (Jews) who are making this transition from the Law of Moses to faith in Christ need to follow this path to its logical and scriptural conclusion. Don't get sidetracked by attempting to create a hybrid doctrine of a little Law and a little faith.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>A different priesthood with a different standard (Hebrews 6:13-20)</b></font><br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">13 &para; For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself, <br>
		    14 saying, &ldquo;Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.&rdquo;<br>
		    15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. <br>
		    16 For men indeed swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is for them an end of all dispute. <br>
		    17 Thus God, determining to show more abundantly to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by an oath, <br>
		    18 that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us.<br>
		    19 &para; This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil, <br>
	      20 where the forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Paul cites the Abrahamic promise of <a href="1-26.html#Abraham" title="Genesis 22 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 22:16-17 (see notes)</a> in verses 13-14. After God tests Abraham regarding the sacrificing of Isaac upon the altar, he renews his covenant with Abraham (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Abrahamic_Covenant.html" title="The Abrahamic Covenant" target="_blank">see The Abrahamic Covenant</a>). Genesis 22:16 quotes God as saying on this occasion, &quot;By Myself I have sworn, says the LORD...&quot; That explains Paul's reference to his point that &quot;<font size="3">He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself.&quot;</font> The promises by God to Abraham were fulfilled (verse 15).</p>
		<p>Now, how does that relate to this discussion? Here it is: Aaron's priesthood was temporary and earthly. Melchizedek's priesthood is permanent and heavenly. That's why under the Aaronic priesthood repeated sacrifices were necessary, but only one permanent sacrifice after Christ - the high priest of the Melchizedek order of priests. <b>The &quot;immutability&quot; of God's oath makes salvation permanent in the Believer.</b> These verses confirm our understanding of verses 4-6 that salvation in Christ is presented here as permanent and not temporal.</p>
		<p>Hold on! Here is the tie in. In verse 18 he refers to &quot;two immutable things.&quot; What are these two things. Well...the first is the promise God made to Abraham (verses 13-17). The other is the fulfillment of God's promise through Jesus Christ, a priest after the order of Melchizedek (verses 19-20). Both &quot;immutable things&quot; are fulfilled in Jesus himself.</p>
