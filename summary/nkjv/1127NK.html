<p>This chapter is a continuation of a prophecy against the City of Tyre that began in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=26#Tyre" title="Ezekiel 26 Summary" target="_blank">Ezekiel 26 (see notes)</a>. <b>There was a real city called Tyre</b> just north of Israel with a real King fighting off the Babylonians like everyone else in the area. Tyre was a much-coveted target of Babylon in that region. It was a magnificent city built in two distinct sections, part on an island one-half mile off the mainland in the Mediterranean Sea and the other part on the mainland. Portions of the wall surrounding the city were as high as 150 feet. According to Josephus, the siege on Tyre by Babylon lasted for 13 years - until around 573 B.C. The result of this siege is not universally agreed upon; some maintain that Nebuchadnezzar was successful and that the King of Tyre was permitted to stay, but as a vassal King of the Babylonian Empire. Nebuchadnezzar himself, it is said, personally supervised the siege for the entire duration. Others have maintained that this particular campaign was not successful, but a later one was. The wording of Ezekiel 29:18 seems to indicate that Nebuchadnezzar defeated Tyre, but that the spoils of battle were less than expected - a disappointing end to a long siege.</p>
<p>The problem with this chapter is that verses 11-19 sound...well...like <b>Ezekiel might be talking about Satan.</b> Hello! Satan! Are you there? The big difficulty with that notion is that <b>he's definitely prophesying about the King of Tyre</b>, a real city with a real king.<b> One possibility may be that Ezekiel is likening the King of Tyre to Satan in the garden with his pride, success, riches, etc. Satan simply cannot be found in this entire prophecy against Tyre and its king. </b>However, verses 13-16, if taken literally and not figuratively, could not be a description, per se, of a human being.<b> So, it is understandable that some have conjectured that Ezekiel may very well be describing Satan himself, comparing those superiority attitudes of Satan leading up to his fall from God's favor to those of the King of Tyre leading up to the fall of his literal kingdom on earth. </b>On the other hand, as several commentators have pointed out, the language of verses 13-16 could have been meaningful, colorful figures of speech used in that day to describe that level of lavishness. <b>The bottom line is this: At the end of the discussion, I don't feel comfortable, myself, concluding that Satan or a doctrine of Satan is included in this prophecy by Ezekiel.</b></p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>A judgment against Sidon (Ezekiel 28:20-23)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">20 &para; Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, <br>
		    21 &ldquo;Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her, <br>
		    22 and say, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD:<br>
&lsquo;Behold, I am against you, O Sidon;<br>
I will be glorified in your midst;<br>
And they shall know that I am the LORD,<br>
When I execute judgments in her and am hallowed in her. <br>
23 	For I will send pestilence upon her,<br>

By the sword against her on every side;<br>
Then they shall know that I am the LORD. <br>
		  </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><b>Then the prophet turns to Tyre's trading partner, Sidon (just 20 miles up the coast) with a prophecy concerning its demise.</b> </p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Israel returns to its homeland (Ezekiel 28:24-26)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">24 &para; &ldquo;And there shall no longer be a pricking brier or a painful thorn for the house of Israel from among all who are around them, who despise them. Then they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.&rdquo; <br>
    25 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;When I have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and am hallowed in them in the sight of the Gentiles, then they will dwell in their own land which I gave to My servant Jacob. <br>
  26 And they will dwell safely there, build houses, and plant vineyards; yes, they will dwell securely, when I execute judgments on all those around them who despise them. Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see in verse 24 that the nations surrounding Israel will no longer have a basis for joy over Israel's demise, inasmuch as they will have fallen to the Babylonians as well. Finally, verses 25-26 make reference to the return of Israel to their homeland. It's difficult to put this prophecy of the return to the land into an absolute context. Does this prophecy point to the return to the land under Cyrus beginning in 535 B.C. or to the yet-future millennium? <b>The judgment mentioned here could be a reference to the fall of Tyre, Sidon and other surrounding nations at the hand of the Babylonians rather than the judgment of Christ at the second coming. There's simply no way to know which of the two possible periods of time is referenced here.</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, <br>
    2 &ldquo;Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt. <br>
    3 Speak, and say, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD:<br>
&ldquo;Behold, I am against you,<br>
O Pharaoh king of Egypt,<br>
O great monster who lies in the midst of his rivers,<br>
Who has said, &lsquo;My River is my own;<br>
I have made it for myself.&rsquo; <br>
4 	But I will put hooks in your jaws,<br>
And cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales;<br>
I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers,<br>
And all the fish in your rivers will stick to your scales. <br>

To the beasts of the field<br>

6 	&ldquo;Then all the inhabitants of Egypt<br>
Shall know that I am the LORD,<br>
Because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. <br>
7 	When they took hold of you with the hand,<br>
You broke and tore all their shoulders;<br>
When they leaned on you,<br>
You broke and made all their backs quiver.&rdquo; <br>
8 &para; &ldquo;Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;Surely I will bring a sword upon you and cut off from you man and beast. <br>
9 And the land of Egypt shall become desolate and waste; then they will know that I am the LORD, because he said, &ldquo;The River is mine, and I have made it.&rsquo; <br>
10 Indeed, therefore, I am against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia. <br>
11 Neither foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast pass through it, and it shall be uninhabited forty years. <br>
12 I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and among the cities that are laid waste, her cities shall be desolate forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries.&rdquo; <br>
13 &para; &ldquo;Yet, thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered. <br>
14 I will bring back the captives of Egypt and cause them to return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they shall be a lowly kingdom. <br>
15 It shall be the lowliest of kingdoms; it shall never again exalt itself above the nations, for I will diminish them so that they will not rule over the nations anymore. <br>
16 No longer shall it be the confidence of the house of Israel, but will remind them of their iniquity when they turned to follow them. Then they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This particular oracle against Egypt was given in January, 587 B.C. according to the data given in verse 1.</p>
<p><b>Concerning the fall of Egypt to Babylon, the Expositor's Bible Commentary says the following:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Since Nebuchadnezzar died in 562 B.C., this predicted desolation of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar&#146;s army would had to have occurred before then. One fragmentary Babylonian text from the chronicles of the Chaldean king (B.M. 33041) implies that Babylonia invaded Egypt about 568/567 B.C. This is corroborated by Josephus (Antiq. X, 180-82 [ix.7]).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>With Egypt falling to the Babylonians around 568 B.C., that would put their return to their land at around 528 B.C. given the 40 years of verses 11-13. No Egyptian records exist to confirm when they were able to return to their land. <b>It is significant to note that Ezekiel prophesied that Egypt would never be a world power again as they had been in the past and that their kingdom will be a &quot;lowly&quot; (i.e. humble) kingdom </b>(verses 14-15).</p>

	<p>Verse 17 gives us a time stamp of April, 571 B.C., about two years after the siege of Tyre was completed. Verses 18-19 seem to indicate that Nebuchadnezzar didn't take enough booty from Tyre to adequately pay his troops. What happened to the riches of Tyre? Could it be that the mention of Tyre and Egypt together here indicates that Tyre was able to ship off their riches to Egypt before their demise? Possibly. Whatever - this prophecy turns on Egypt and verse 20 indicates Egypt's fall to Babylon.</p>
	<p>Verse 21 is curious. What does it mean when it says, &quot;In that day I will cause the horn of the house of Israel to spring forth, and I will open your mouth to speak in their midst. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.&quot; Well, it's definitely not messianic, and Israel did not return to the land until 535 B.C. However, the defeat of Egypt would have been a great encouragement to the exiles as they witnessed the prophecy of 587 B.C. (Ezekiel 29:1-16, <a href="#Egypt">see above</a>) by Ezekiel coming to fruition. It was a vindication of God's prophecies concerning Egypt and Israel. </p>
	<p>Into chapter 30 we see that Egypt will fall despite the assistance of its allies. Babylon will be on a roll. Verse 13 declares, &quot;...There shall no longer be princes from the land of Egypt...&quot; Egypt's demise will be devastating and thorough according to the stipulations of the prophecy of this chapter.</p>

	<p>Just so there's no mistake, here's yet another prophecy given by Ezekiel in April, 587 B.C., a few months after the one in chapter 29 (<a href="#Egypt">see above</a>) concerning Egypt (Compare 29:1 to 30:20). No improvement in their prospects are seen here; Egypt is still going to fall. It is interesting that the prophecy of Ezekiel 29:17-30:19 was given much later, but is included in between the other two. The deportation and exile of Egyptians is clearly prophesied after their fall. This technique was used by the Babylonians and Assyrians before them to destroy national pride by mixing different nationalities within regions that had been conquered.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Now it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying, <br>
    2 &ldquo;Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude:<br>
&lsquo;Whom are you like in your greatness? <br>
3 	Indeed Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon,<br>
With fine branches that shaded the forest,<br>
And of high stature;<br>
And its top was among the thick boughs. <br>
4 	The waters made it grow;<br>
Underground waters gave it height,<br>
With their rivers running around the place where it was planted,<br>
And sent out rivulets to all the trees of the field. <br>
5 	&ldquo;Therefore its height was exalted above all the trees of the field;<br>
Its boughs were multiplied,<br>
And its branches became long because of the abundance of water,<br>
As it sent them out. <br>
6 	All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs;<br>
Under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young;<br>
And in its shadow all great nations made their home. <br>
7 	&ldquo;Thus it was beautiful in greatness and in the length of its branches,<br>
Because its roots reached to abundant waters. <br>
8 	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it;<br>
The fir trees were not like its boughs,<br>
And the chestnut trees were not like its branches;<br>
No tree in the garden of God was like it in beauty. <br>
9 	I made it beautiful with a multitude of branches,<br>
So that all the trees of Eden envied it,<br>
That were in the garden of God.&rsquo; <br>
10 &para; &ldquo;Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;Because you have increased in height, and it set its top among the thick boughs, and its heart was lifted up in its height, <br>
11 therefore I will deliver it into the hand of the mighty one of the nations, and he shall surely deal with it; I have driven it out for its wickedness. <br>
12 And aliens, the most terrible of the nations, have cut it down and left it; its branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys; its boughs lie broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the peoples of the earth have gone from under its shadow and left it. <br>
13 	&ldquo;On its ruin will remain all the birds of the heavens,<br>
And all the beasts of the field will come to its branches&mdash; <br>
14 &ldquo;So that no trees by the waters may ever again exalt themselves for their height, nor set their tops among the thick boughs, that no tree which drinks water may ever be high enough to reach up to them.<br>
&lsquo;For they have all been delivered to death,<br>
To the depths of the earth,<br>
Among the children of men who go down to the Pit.&rsquo; <br>
15 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;In the day when it went down to hell, I caused mourning. I covered the deep because of it. I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were held back. I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted because of it. <br>
16 I made the nations shake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to hell together with those who descend into the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the depths of the earth. <br>
17 They also went down to hell with it, with those slain by the sword; and those who were its strong arm dwelt in its shadows among the nations. <br>
18 &para; &ldquo;To which of the trees in Eden will you then be likened in glory and greatness? Yet you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the depths of the earth; you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,&rsquo; says the Lord GOD.&rdquo; </font></p>

<p>This prophecy was issued in June, 587 B.C. just a couple of months after the prophecy beginning in 30:20, Ezekiel gives another concerning Egypt. The Assyrians (verse 3) are compared to the tall, strong trees of Lebanon, but yet they fell to the Babylonians. If an empire as great as the Assyrians could fall to Babylon, why would Egypt think they are immune? Nineveh, the seat of the Assyrian Empire, fell to the Babylonians in 609 B.C. This followed the fall of Assyria's hold as an empire 17 years earlier in 626 B.C. </p>
