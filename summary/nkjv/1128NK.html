<p><font size="4"><b>Whoa! Another prophecy on Egypt? (Ezekiel 32:1-16)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying, <br>
    2 &ldquo;Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him:<br>
&lsquo;You are like a young lion among the nations,<br>
And you are like a monster in the seas,<br>
Bursting forth in your rivers,<br>
Troubling the waters with your feet,<br>
And fouling their rivers.&rsquo; <br>
3 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD:<br>
&lsquo;I will therefore spread My net over you with a company of many people,<br>
And they will draw you up in My net. <br>
4 	Then I will leave you on the land;<br>
I will cast you out on the open fields,<br>
And cause to settle on you all the birds of the heavens.<br>
And with you I will fill the beasts of the whole earth. <br>
5 	I will lay your flesh on the mountains,<br>
And fill the valleys with your carcass. <br>
6 	&ldquo;I will also water the land with the flow of your blood,<br>
Even to the mountains;<br>
And the riverbeds will be full of you. <br>
7 	When I put out your light,<br>
I will cover the heavens, and make its stars dark;<br>
I will cover the sun with a cloud,<br>
And the moon shall not give her light. <br>
8 	All the bright lights of the heavens I will make dark over you,<br>
And bring darkness upon your land,&rsquo;<br>
Says the Lord GOD. <br>
9 &para; &ldquo;I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known. <br>
10 Yes, I will make many peoples astonished at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid of you when I brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.&rsquo; <br>
11 &para; &ldquo;For thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you. <br>
12 By the swords of the mighty warriors, all of them the most terrible of the nations, I will cause your multitude to fall.<br>
&ldquo;They shall plunder the pomp of Egypt,<br>
And all its multitude shall be destroyed. <br>
13 	Also I will destroy all its animals<br>
From beside its great waters;<br>
The foot of man shall muddy them no more,<br>
Nor shall the hooves of animals muddy them. <br>
14 	Then I will make their waters clear,<br>
And make their rivers run like oil,&rsquo;<br>
Says the Lord GOD. <br>
15 	&ldquo;When I make the land of Egypt desolate,<br>
And the country is destitute of all that once filled it,<br>
When I strike all who dwell in it,<br>
Then they shall know that I am the LORD. <br>
16 	&ldquo;This is the lamentation<br>
With which they shall lament her;<br>
The daughters of the nations shall lament her;<br>
They shall lament for her, for Egypt,<br>
And for all her multitude,&rsquo;<br>
Says the Lord GOD.&rdquo; <br>

<p>Here's yet another prophecy regarding the fall of Egypt; this series began in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=27#Egypt" title="Ezekiel 29 Summary" target="_blank">Ezekiel 29 (see notes)</a>. Based upon the data given to us in verse 1, we know that this one was given in March, 585 B.C., in year 12 and month 12 after Jehoiachin had been dethroned and imprisoned in Babylon - the same time that Zedekiah had become the Babylonian-appointed King of Judah. <b> At this point, Jerusalem has fallen, just as Ezekiel had already prophesied;</b> we see from Ezekiel 33:21 (<a href="#Watchman">see below</a>) that the news of the fall had reached these exiles two months earlier. Misery loves company. </p>
<p>For a comprehensive look at the fall of Jerusalem, <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=11#End" title="Jeremiah 52 Summary" target="_blank">click here to see the notes on Jeremiah 52.</a></p>
<p>Since Jerusalem has fallen, what about Egypt? Is God going to do what he said he would with them also? Yup! Here it is in this chapter - the final two prophecies on the fall of Egypt from Ezekiel. Pharaoh's demise gets some mention in this one. Verse 11 makes clear that Babylon is the conquering culprit here.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>And...one more, a</b></font><font size="4"><b> final prophecy on Egypt (Ezekiel 32:17-32)</b></font><br>

  <p><font size="2">17 &para; It came to pass also in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying: <br>
    18 	&ldquo;Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt,<br>
And cast them down to the depths of the earth,<br>
Her and the daughters of the famous nations,<br>
With those who go down to the Pit: <br>
19 	&ldquo;Whom do you surpass in beauty?<br>
Go down, be placed with the uncircumcised.&rsquo; <br>
20 	&ldquo;They shall fall in the midst of those slain by the sword;<br>

It was put in the midst of the slain. <br>
26 	&ldquo;There are Meshech and Tubal and all their multitudes,<br>
With all their graves around it,<br>
All of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword,<br>

Who are fallen of the uncircumcised,<br>
Who have gone down to hell with their weapons of war;<br>
They have laid their swords under their heads,<br>
But their iniquities will be on their bones,<br>
Because of the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. <br>
28 	Yes, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,<br>
And lie with those slain by the sword. <br>
29 	&ldquo;There is Edom,<br>
Her kings and all her princes,<br>
Who despite their might<br>
Are laid beside those slain by the sword;<br>
They shall lie with the uncircumcised,<br>
And with those who go down to the Pit. <br>
30 	There are the princes of the north,<br>
All of them, and all the Sidonians,<br>
Who have gone down with the slain<br>
In shame at the terror which they caused by their might;<br>
They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword,<br>
And bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit. <br>
31 	&ldquo;Pharaoh will see them<br>
And be comforted over all his multitude,<br>
Pharaoh and all his army,<br>
Slain by the sword,&rdquo;<br>

And he shall be placed in the midst of the uncircumcised<br>
With those slain by the sword,<br>
Pharaoh and all his multitude,&rdquo;<br>
Says the Lord GOD. </font></p>

<p>This prophecy was issued in April, 585 B.C.; it follows by one month the preceding prophecy at the beginning of this chapter and basically assigns Egypt their place with all the other surrounding nations - death and destruction. While Egypt was one of the last nations in the region left standing (so to speak), the nation did fall to the Babylonians around 568 B.C. as Ezekiel had prophesied.</p>

			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying, <br>
		    2 &ldquo;Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them: &lsquo;When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from their territory and make him their watchman, <br>
		    3 when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the trumpet and warns the people, <br>
		    4 then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be on his own head. <br>
		    5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, but did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he who takes warning will save his life. <br>
		    6 But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchman&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo; <br>
		    7 &para; &ldquo;So you, son of man: I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear a word from My mouth and warn them for Me. <br>
		    8 When I say to the wicked, &ldquo;O wicked man, you shall surely die!&rsquo; and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. <br>
		    9 Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul. <br>
		    10 &para; &ldquo;Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: &ldquo;Thus you say, &lsquo;If our transgressions and our sins lie upon us, and we pine away in them, how can we then live?&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; <br>
		    11 Say to them: &ldquo;As I live,&rsquo; says the Lord GOD, &lsquo;I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?&rsquo; <br>
		    12 &para; &ldquo;Therefore you, O son of man, say to the children of your people: &lsquo;The righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live because of his righteousness in the day that he sins.&rsquo; <br>
		    13 When I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous works shall be remembered; but because of the iniquity that he has committed, he shall die. <br>
		    14 Again, when I say to the wicked, &ldquo;You shall surely die,&rsquo; if he turns from his sin and does what is lawful and right, <br>
		    15 if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die. <br>
		    16 None of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered against him; he has done what is lawful and right; he shall surely live. <br>
		    17 &para; &ldquo;Yet the children of your people say, &lsquo;The way of the LORD is not fair.&rsquo; But it is their way which is not fair! <br>
		    18 When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die because of it. <br>
		    19 But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right, he shall live because of it. <br>
		    20 Yet you say, &ldquo;The way of the LORD is not fair.&rsquo; O house of Israel, I will judge every one of you according to his own ways.&rdquo; <br>
		    21 &para; And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, that one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, &ldquo;The city has been captured!&rdquo; <br>
		    22 &para; Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the man came who had escaped. And He had opened my mouth; so when he came to me in the morning, my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute. <br>
		    23 &para; Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying: <br>
		    24 &ldquo;Son of man, they who inhabit those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, &lsquo;Abraham was only one, and he inherited the land. But we are many; the land has been given to us as a possession.&rsquo; <br>
		    25 &para; &ldquo;Therefore say to them, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;You eat meat with blood, you lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood. Should you then possess the land? <br>
		    26 You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and you defile one another&rsquo;s wives. Should you then possess the land?&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; <br>
		    27 &para; &ldquo;Say thus to them, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;As I live, surely those who are in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and the one who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and caves shall die of the pestilence. <br>
		    28 For I will make the land most desolate, her arrogant strength shall cease, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through. <br>
		    29 Then they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; <br>
		    30 &para; &ldquo;As for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses; and they speak to one another, everyone saying to his brother, &lsquo;Please come and hear what the word is that comes from the LORD.&rsquo; <br>
		    31 So they come to you as people do, they sit before you as My people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their hearts pursue their own gain. <br>
		    32 Indeed you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not do them. <br>
	      33 And when this comes to pass&mdash;surely it will come&mdash;then they will know that a prophet has been among them.&rdquo; </font></p>

	<p>There's no need to prophesy concerning the fall of Jerusalem at this point; it's already happened. Ezekiel told them and told them, but all they did was hate him for it. Tough! It's his job to &quot;warn the wicked&quot; (verses 8-9). In verses 10-20, Ezekiel stresses the importance of individual obedience on behalf of these exiled Jews. <b>Then in verse 21 the message comes from an escapee of Jerusalem that the city has fallen.</b> It's been a tough seven-plus years for Ezekiel since he began prophesying about this. As a matter of fact, he didn't speak except to prophesy for the whole time (<a title="Ezekiel 3 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=15#God" target="_blank"><b>Ezekiel 3:24-27, </b>see notes</a>). Here in verse 22 we see that he can speak again; his muteness is gone. Ezekiel is told that now the people will know that he had prophesied correctly.</p>
	<p><b>Here are some dates of interest regarding the fall of Jerusalem:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>December/January, 589/588 B.C. - the siege on Jerusalem was begun by the Babylonians.
			<li>September, 586 B.C. - Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians.
			<li>December/January, 586/585 B.C. - The refugee in verse 21 shows up in Babylonia to report the fall.
		</ul>
		<p>You will notice that the siege on Jerusalem lasted for about 31 months. It took 5 months for word to get back to the exiles in Babylonia that Jerusalem had fallen.</p>
		<p><b>Some have taken this passage out of context to be a universal lesson on a Believer's responsibility to witness to the lost and the consequences for not doing so. In rendering this passage as such, they surmise that the physical death spoken of here is really a reference spiritual death and that those who had salvation in Christ can lose it. It's a very dishonest way of teaching that one can lose one's salvation, and it's all done by grossly misrepresenting scripture. Likewise these teachers have done with Ezekiel's comments about his responsibility to warn the Jews in </b><a title="Ezekiel 3 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=15#God" target="_blank"><b>Ezekiel 3 </b>(see notes)</a><b> and </b><a title="Ezekiel 18 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=22#Sins" target="_blank"><b>Ezekiel 18</b> (see notes)</a><b>. As a matter of fact, notice the clarity in this passage that this warning is designed to motivate Ezekiel to take his warning to the &quot;house of Israel&quot; </b>(verses 7, 10, 11, 20).</p>

		<p>In that culture it was common to refer to a nation's leaders as that nation's shepherds. Israel had some bad, bad shepherds - caused the nation to sin and ultimately fall. That's Ezekiel's theme in this chapter. We find the indictment against these leaders in verses 1-10. </p>

		    14 I will feed them in good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. <br>
		    15 I will feed My flock, and I will make them lie down,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD. <br>
		    16 &ldquo;I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up the broken and strengthen what was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong, and feed them in judgment.&rdquo; <br>
		    17 &para; &ldquo;And as for you, O My flock, thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;Behold, I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats. <br>
		    18 Is it too little for you to have eaten up the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture&mdash;and to have drunk of the clear waters, that you must foul the residue with your feet? <br>
		    19 And as for My flock, they eat what you have trampled with your feet, and they drink what you have fouled with your feet.&rdquo; <br>
		    20 &para; &ldquo;Therefore thus says the Lord GOD to them: &lsquo;Behold, I Myself will judge between the fat and the lean sheep. <br>
		    21 Because you have pushed with side and shoulder, butted all the weak ones with your horns, and scattered them abroad, <br>
		    22 therefore I will save My flock, and they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep. <br>
		    23 I will establish one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them&mdash;My servant David. He shall feed them and be their shepherd. <br>
		    24 And I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David a prince among them; I, the LORD, have spoken. <br>
		    25 &para; &ldquo;I will make a covenant of peace with them, and cause wild beasts to cease from the land; and they will dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods. <br>
		    26 I will make them and the places all around My hill a blessing; and I will cause showers to come down in their season; there shall be showers of blessing. <br>
		    27 Then the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase. They shall be safe in their land; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them. <br>
		    28 And they shall no longer be a prey for the nations, nor shall beasts of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and no one shall make them afraid. <br>
		    29 I will raise up for them a garden of renown, and they shall no longer be consumed with hunger in the land, nor bear the shame of the Gentiles anymore. <br>
		    30 Thus they shall know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and they, the house of Israel, are My people,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
	      31 &para; &ldquo;You are My flock, the flock of My pasture; you are men, and I am your God,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD. </font></p>

	<p>Then, in verses 11-24, we find a promise to gather those scattered sheep back together into one place; that's the millennium. We know so because of the clear mention of David in verse 24. The judgment that takes place here in verse 17 equates to the judgments of <a title="Matthew 25 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=21#Continuation" target="_blank">Matthew 25 (see notes)</a> which take place just prior to the beginning of the millennium. THE good shepherd will then rule over Israel; that's the Messiah, Jesus. <b>It is no wonder the &quot;good-shepherd&quot; metaphor of </b><a title="John 10 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=3#Pharisees" target="_blank"><b>John 10</b> (see notes)</a><b> angered the Pharisees so much. They immediately would have equated those words with this chapter concerning the coming Messiah.</b></p>
	<p><b>Then we get a taste of what life on earth during the millennium will be like in verses 25-31</b><b>: </b></p>
<ul>
			<li>God will rule with David among the people of Israel
			<li>No fear of harm from predator animals

			<li>Appropriate seasonal rainfall
			<li>Complete security from man or beast
			<li>No more hunger
			<li>A restored relationship between God and the people. 
		</ul>
		<p>A clarification needs to be made to distinguish this period as the Messianic Kingdom. We anticipate the implementation of the kingdom in what we commonly call the millennium. The millennium is a distinct period of 1,000 years presented to us by John in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=31#Millennium" title="Revelation 20 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 20 (see notes)</a>. During that period, Satan will be bound; he will have no influence over the inhabitants of the earth. Moreover, the Jewish people will have been purged prior to the beginning of the millennium, and all Jewish people will be living under the provisions of the New Covenant outlined in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=30#Covenant" title="Jeremiah 31 Summary" target="_blank">Jeremiah 31:31-34 (see notes)</a>. At the end of the millennium, Satan will be loosed and will subsequently organize a great rebellion of Gentiles against the Messiah. These wicked Gentiles will be comprised of those Gentiles who were born during the millennium and chose not to acknowledge Jesus as Savior and Messiah. There is no scriptural indication that any Jews will join this rebellion.</p>
		<p>After the rebellion is quashed by the Messiah, a New Heaven and New Earth will be established wherein evil will no longer exist (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=31#New" title="Revelation 21 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 21, see notes</a>).</p>
