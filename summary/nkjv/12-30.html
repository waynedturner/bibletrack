	<p><font size="4"><b>An introduction to Malachi</b></font><br>
</b><font size="3">We don't know exactly when Malachi prophesied. We do know that it had to have been written after the rebuilding of Zerubbabel's Temple, completed in 515 B.C. Good scholars disagree on their preference for an exact date after 515 B.C. However, we do have strong clues that would help us zero in more closely on a date.</font><b><br>
				</b></font></p>
		<p><b><font size="3">Let's establish a time line of known events to help us intelligently speculate on the dating of the Book of Malachi:</font></b></p>
<ul>
			<li><font size="3">Those exiled from Judah/Jerusalem to Babylon began returning in 535 B.C (<a href="12-14.html#Cyrus" title="Ezra 1 Summary" target="_blank">Ezra 1, see notes</a>).</font>
			<li><font size="3">Zerubbabel (governor and descendant of King David), with the assistance of prophets Haggai and Zechariah, led the people to rebuild the temple  in 515 B.C. (<a href="12-14.html#Temple" title="Ezra 3 Summary" target="_blank">Ezra 3:7-13, see notes</a>).</font>
<li><font size="3">Ezra (priest and scribe) arrived in Jerusalem with more exiles in 458 B.C.</font>
			(<a href="12-24.html#Town" title="Ezra 7 Summary" target="_blank">Ezra 7, see notes</a>)
<li><font size="3">Nehemiah arrived in 445 B.C. with authority to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem. He assumed the position of governor of Israel (<a href="12-25.html#Face" title="Nehemiah 2 Summary" target="_blank">Nehemiah 2, see notes</a>).</font>
			<li><font size="3">In Nehemiah's twelfth year as governor (434/433 B.C.), he returned to Persia for an unspecified period of time (compare <a href="12-26.html#Nehemiah" title="Nehemiah 5 Summary" target="_blank">Nehemiah 5:14, see notes</a> to <a href="12-29.html#Reforms" title="Nehemiah 13 Summary" target="_blank">Nehemiah 13:6, see notes</a>) before his return to Jerusalem.</font>
  <li><font size="3">Malachi began his prophetic ministry in Judah. We have no exact time indicated, but the temple had been rebuilt. There is also a notable deficiency in the way the inhabitants of Judah/Jerusalem were worshipping and caring for the temple. That would suggest that Malachi's ministry was active some time after 434 B.C. when Nehemiah had returned to Persia.</font>

4 	Even though Edom has said,<br>
&ldquo;We have been impoverished,<br>
But we will return and build the desolate places,&rdquo; &para; Thus says the LORD of hosts:<br>
&ldquo;They may build, but I will throw down;<br>
They shall be called the Territory of Wickedness,<br>

And you shall say,<br>
&ldquo;The LORD is magnified beyond the border of Israel.&rsquo;<br>

	<p><b>The Edomites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother.</b> Throughout Jewish history, they'd experienced some good times, but no more. <b>Malachi's prophecy for these people is bleak - gone forever.</b> Their land had been east of south Israel. However, they were driven out of their land into the southern part of Judah, never to return to their own land again. Edom had sought to block Israel&#146;s first entrance into Canaan (<a title="Numbers 20 Summary" href="3-24.html#Esau" target="_blank">Numbers 20:14-21, see notes</a>; <a title="Numbers 24 Summary" href="3-27.html#Curse" target="_blank">Numbers 24:15-19, see notes</a>).</p>

		<p><b>During the period between the Testaments, the Maccabean period, John Hyrcanus compelled the people to become Jews and to submit to circumcision.</b> By New Testament times we see them in Judah identified as people from Idumea (<a href="1-29.html#Movement" title="Mark 3 Summary" target="_blank">Mark 3:8, see notes</a>), which is what this southern part of Judah came to be known as. The entire Book of Obadiah was a prophecy against the Edomites prophesying their utter dissolution. Likewise, Jeremiah issues a stinging prophecy regarding their impending fall to the Babylonians in <a title="Jeremiah 49 Summary" href="11-10.html#Ammonites" target="_blank">Jeremiah 49 (see notes)</a>. <b>Well, in Malachi's day this fall had already taken place, and their demise was to be permanent according to verse 4; these Edomites would be known as &quot;the people against whom the LORD will have indignation forever.&quot;</b></p>
	<p>Paul uses verses 2-3 in this passage to make his point in <a href="8-21.html#Israel" title="Romans 9 Summary" target="_blank">Romans 9:13 (see notes)</a>. Esau was the father of the Edomites, while Jacob was the father of the Jews.</p>

	<p>&quot;That animal's blind; it'll make a good sacrifice down at the temple.&quot; Such was the practice of the priests with the sacrifices at their newly-rebuilt temple. So much for the provisions of the Mosaic law requiring unblemished sacrifices in <a title="Leviticus 1-4 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=02&dy=28#How" target="_blank">Leviticus 1-4 (see notes)</a>. They brought lame and sickly animals as sacrifices as well. Malachi proclaims that this practice is &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;contemptible.&quot; Both the people bringing the sacrifices and the priests who accept them should be ashamed!</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Yuck! What's that on your face? (Malachi 2:1-9)</b></font><br>

  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;And now, O priests, this commandment is for you. <br>
    2 	If you will not hear,<br>

Says the LORD of hosts,<br>
&ldquo;I will send a curse upon you,<br>
And I will curse your blessings.<br>
Yes, I have cursed them already,<br>

That My covenant with Levi may continue,&rdquo;<br>
Says the LORD of hosts. <br>
5 	&ldquo;My covenant was with him, one of life and peace,<br>
And I gave them to him that he might fear Me;<br>
So he feared Me<br>
And was reverent before My name. <br>
6 	The law of truth was in his mouth,<br>
And injustice was not found on his lips.<br>
He walked with Me in peace and equity,<br>
And turned many away from iniquity. <br>
7 	&ldquo;For the lips of a priest should keep knowledge,<br>

8 	But you have departed from the way;<br>
You have caused many to stumble at the law.<br>
You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,&rdquo;<br>

<p>These priests surely didn't get the big picture. Here's that &quot;talkin' to&quot; they desperately needed - and extremely blunt. Verse 3 may just take your appetite away, &quot;Behold, I will rebuke your descendants And spread refuse on your faces, The refuse of your solemn feasts; And one will take you away with it.&quot;<b> Malachi is referring to the internal excrement (&quot;dung&quot;) from the sacrificed animals which was ordinarily carried outside the camp for disposal after the sacrifice.</b> Malachi's prophecy strongly suggests that their corrupt actions regarding their sacrificial practices are not meeting God's approval. <b>They are disgracing the Levite tradition.</b> Verse 8 proclaims that they are causing people in Israel to stumble because of their actions. Were these priests well respected? According to verse 9, I guess not, &quot;Therefore I also have made you contemptible and base Before all the people,&quot;</p>

<p><b>These Jewish men were marrying young women of the land who worshiped false gods.</b> Moreover, some were apparently divorcing their old wives to make room for the new pagan-worshiping ones. Verse 16 makes it clear that God despised this practice. To marry a pagan-worshipping woman is to forsake God, because one is saying that it makes no difference who your god is. So you see, this practice wasn't just the actions of unbridled lust, but rather a forsaking of God himself. </p>
<p><b>Perhaps Paul was thinking of this passage of scripture when he wrote in </b><a title="II Corinthians 6 Summary" href="9-18.html#Who" target="_blank"><b>II Corinthians 6:14-18</b> (see notes)</a><b>:</b></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p> <strong>Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers.</strong> For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness? And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: 	&ldquo;I will dwell in them 	And walk among them. 	I will be their God, 	And they shall be My people.&rdquo; Therefore 	&ldquo;<strong>Come out from among them 	And be separate, says the Lord. 	Do not touch what is unclean,</strong> 	And I will receive you.&rdquo; 	&ldquo;I will be a Father to you, 	And you shall be My sons and daughters, 	Says the LORD Almighty.&rdquo; </p>

&lsquo;What have we spoken against You?&rsquo; <br>
14 	You have said,<br>
&ldquo;It is useless to serve God;<br>
What profit is it that we have kept His ordinance,<br>
And that we have walked as mourners<br>
Before the LORD of hosts? <br>
15 	So now we call the proud blessed,<br>
For those who do wickedness are raised up;<br>
They even tempt God and go free.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
16 	Then those who feared the LORD spoke to one another,<br>
And the LORD listened and heard them;<br>
So a book of remembrance was written before Him<br>
For those who fear the LORD<br>
And who meditate on His name. <br>
17 	&ldquo;They shall be Mine,&rdquo; says the LORD of hosts,<br>
&ldquo;On the day that I make them My jewels.<br>
And I will spare them<br>
As a man spares his own son who serves him.&rdquo; <br>
18 	Then you shall again discern<br>
Between the righteous and the wicked,<br>
Between one who serves God<br>
And one who does not serve Him.</font></p>

<p>So, Israel is back, but they're not really back - not with right attitude anyway. <b>Their hearts didn't really seem to be into nation rebuilding.</b> We saw in chapter 1 (<a href="#Tough">see above</a>) that their sacrifices were intentionally substandard - a clear violation of Mosaic law. Now we see that they did not want to contribute to the very centerpiece of their national pride - their temple. <b>They obviously did not want to pay the price of national restoration.</b> Malachi's admonition to them is simple, &quot;Do right!&quot;</p>
<p>It is necessary to point out that in 535 B.C. when the exiles first began returning to Israel, they were very excited about their national prospects. Now that they have been back in their homeland for a century or so, they have lapsed back into the same frame of mind that caused their fall to the Babylonians in the first place. They had lost their vision to recapture the spirit of the Old Israel. Nominal service was really all they gave God at this point. Malachi's words here are intended to fire the people back up as we see his very confrontational statement in verse 8, &quot;Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, 'In what way have we robbed You?' In tithes and offerings.&quot;  Then notice his words in verse 9, &quot;You are cursed with a curse, For you have robbed Me, Even this whole nation.&quot; Sometimes it just takes an in-your-face declaration to shake people up.</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;For behold, the day is coming,<br>
Burning like an oven,<br>
And all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble.<br>
And the day which is coming shall burn them up,&rdquo;<br>
Says the LORD of hosts,<br>
&ldquo;That will leave them neither root nor branch. <br>
2 	But to you who fear My name<br>
The Sun of Righteousness shall arise<br>
With healing in His wings;<br>
And you shall go out<br>
And grow fat like stall-fed calves. <br>
3 	You shall trample the wicked,<br>
For they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet<br>
On the day that I do this,&rdquo;<br>
Says the LORD of hosts. <br>
4 	&ldquo;Remember the Law of Moses, My servant,<br>
Which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel,<br>
With the statutes and judgments. <br>
5 	Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet<br>
Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD. <br>
6 	And he will turn<br>
The hearts of the fathers to the children,<br>
And the hearts of the children to their fathers,<br>
Lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.&rdquo; </font></p>

	<p>Well, we know who Elijah is (<a href="8-26.html#Elijah" title="I Kings 17 Summary" target="_blank">I Kings 17, see notes</a>), but what about the future. We already saw in chapter 3 (<a href="#John">see above</a>) that Jesus identifies the messenger as John the Baptist. </p>
	<p><b>Look at verses 5-6 here regarding the coming of Elijah:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet 	Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD. 	And he will turn 	The hearts of the fathers to the children, 	And the hearts of the children to their fathers, 	Lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.&rdquo; </p>

	<p>While John the Baptist did introduce Jesus at the first advent, the nation of Israel rejected Jesus as their Messiah at that time; that's key to understanding the role of John the Baptist in this prophecy. <font size="3"><a title="John/Elijah Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.com/notes/resource/misc/John-Elijah.html" target="_blank">Click here to view the article on Jesus' identification of John the Baptist as a fulfillment of this prophecy.</a> </font><b>The reference to &quot;the great and dreadful day of the LORD&quot; is surely addressing the Battle of Armageddon in </b><a title="Revelation 19 Summary" href="12-27.html#Armageddon" target="_blank"><b>Revelation 19:11-21</b> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> Therefore, certainly this reference must be to the appearance of the two prophets in <a title="Revelation 11 Summary" href="12-19.html#Witnesses" target="_blank">Revelation 11:1-14 (see notes)</a> before the Battle of Armageddon takes place. It is obvious to most Bible students that one of the witnesses of Revelation 11 must be Elijah. So, <b>Malachi's prophecy describes the ministry of the Messiah at his first and second advents.</b></p>
