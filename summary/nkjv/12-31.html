<p><a name="Millennium"></a><font size="4"><b>The millennium and defeat of Satan (Revelation 20:1-10)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.<br />
2 He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;<br />
3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while.<br />
4 &para; And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.<br />
5 But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.<br />
6 Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.<br />
7 &para; Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison<br />
8 and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.<br />
9 They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.<br />
10 The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the setting for yet-future events of chapter 20. The Battle of Armageddon has been fought and won against the Antichrist and his forces (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=27#Armageddon" target="_blank" title="Revelation 19 Summary">Revelation 19:11-21, see notes</a>); the tribulation period of seven years is over. At this point in time, Satan is bound for 1,000 years at the beginning of the millennium (verse 3). First, however, there&#39;s a resurrection of the slain tribulation saints who will reign with Christ for 1,000 years. The only Biblical reference to a prophetic millennium is found here in Revelation 20.</p>

<p>The bottomless pit of verse 1 is from the Greek word &quot;abussos,&quot; which is transliterated into our English word, &quot; abyss.&quot; For Satan, this is a temporary stay...ONLY 1,000 years. The Greek word for &quot;nations&quot; in verse 3 is &quot;ethnos&quot; which is used in the New Testament as a reference to non-Jewish people. We&#39;ll see the release of Satan down in verses 7-10.</p>

<p><strong>Let&#39;s take note of the following regarding the millennium:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>It does not fulfill all of the Old Testament Messianic prophecies...especially the FOREVER part.</li>
	<li>Everyone starts out saved, but many do not get saved during the 1,000-year period...and they rebel down in verses 7-10.</li>
	<li>When the millennium ends, a new Heaven, Earth and Jerusalem will be created...Revelation 21-22 (<a href="#New">see below</a>)</li>
	<li>There will be a physical temple on earth during the millennium, but not afterward.<br />
	Ezekiel&#39;s temple is detailed in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=2#Temple" target="_blank" title="Ezekiel 40 Summary">Ezekiel 40-48 (see notes)</a>.<br />
	There is no temple in the New Jerusalem according to Revelation 21:22 (<a href="#Jerusalem">see below</a>).</li>
	<li>There will be peace under the Messiah...forced compliance, but peaceful.</li>
</ul>

<p>The structure of verses 4-5 is confusing. The &quot;first resurrection&quot; of verse 5 is a reference to the resurrection of the people described in verse 4, the ones who &quot;lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.&quot; There is a parenthetical statement in verse 5, &quot;But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished.&quot; That is NOT a reference to the &quot;first resurrection&quot; people, but rather refers to the people who decline salvation in Jesus Christ and are to appear before the white throne judgment of verses 11-15 (<a href="#White">see below</a>).</p>

<p><b>Let&#39;s take a look at the collective resurrections that take place in scriptures:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Old Testament Believers - at the resurrection of Jesus (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=6&amp;dy=22#Curtain" target="_blank" title="Matthew 27 Summary">Matthew 27:52-53, see notes</a>; <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=10&amp;dy=08#Ephesians" target="_blank" title="Ephesians 4 Summary">Ephesians 4:8-10, see notes</a>)</li>
	<li>Those saved since the resurrection of Jesus at the rapture (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=20#Rapture" target="_blank" title="I Thessalonians 4 Summary">I Thessalonians 4:13-18, see notes</a>; <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=10#Mystery" target="_blank" title="I Corinthians 15 Summary">I Corinthians 15:51-58, see notes</a>)</li>
	<li>Those saved between the rapture and the second coming of Christ at the end of the tribulation (Revelation 20:4-6)</li>
	<li>Those who have declined to trust God by faith prior to the first incarnation of Jesus and those who have rejected Jesus as Savior since (Revelation 20:5, 11-15, <a href="#White">see below</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>You will notice that the wicked dead aren&#39;t resurrected until after the millennium</b> (verses 4-5)<b>. </b>After this 1,000-year period, Satan is loosed only for a short time (verse 7), but long enough to gather an army of rebels who will have declined to get saved during the millennium (verses 8-9). <b>NOTE: the millennium starts out with all saved people, but this rebel force will be made up of people born during the millennium who decline a personal relationship with Christ.</b> While they will obey under the righteous rule of the Messiah, it is not in their hearts to do so; <b>they will only obey the Messiah out of necessity.</b> Of course Satan is defeated once and for all at the end of the millennium and cast into his final home, the Lake of Fire (verse 10).</p>

<p>So, who are the people of verse 4? It says of them, &quot;And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them...&quot; While we aren&#39;t told for certain, that seems like an easy call. The rapture (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=20#Rapture" target="_blank" title="I Thessalonians 4 Summary">I Thessalonians 4:13-18, see notes</a>; <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=10#Mystery" target="_blank" title="I Corinthians 15 Summary">I Corinthians 15:51-58, see notes</a>) takes all Believers to Heaven where we are told in I Thessalonians 4:17, &quot;...And thus we shall always be with the Lord.&quot; Paul asks this rhetorical question in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=2#Lawsuits" target="_blank" title="I Corinthians 6 Summary">I Corinthians 6:2 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?&quot; I&#39;m convinced that Paul taught that the saints (Believers) will be part of the millennium ruling team, so they are likely the ones sitting on the thrones here in verse 4. That notion is confirmed in verse 6 where it is said of them, &quot;...but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.&quot; There can be no question but that the priesthood of the Believer is a clear New Testament doctrine (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=11#Introduction" target="_blank" title="Revelation 1 Summary">Revelation 1:6, see notes</a>; <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=11&amp;dy=25#Who" target="_blank" title="I Peter 2 Summary">I Peter 2:9, see notes</a>).</p>

<p><b>Let&#39;s be clear about this very important aspect of the yet-future millennium.</b> This is the Messianic kingdom prophesied by the prophets of the Old Testament. However, the Old Testament prophets saw <b>two distinct periods</b>, the 1,000 year millennium AND the new Heaven and Earth which begins in Revelation 21:1 (<a href="#New">see below</a>). After the creation of the new Heaven and Earth, the earth will no longer be populated by unregenerate people; all will be God&#39;s people. However, during the millennium, there will appear a growing number of descendants of the original millennium inhabitants who will decline a faith relationship with the Messiah. Nevertheless, these people WILL comply with the wishes of the Messiah all the way down to the end of the millennium, at which time Satan will gather them as his allies in battle when he is loosed (verse 7). That event (verses 8-10) marks the end of all resistance against God for eternity.</p>

<p>The existence of potential enemies during this period is not a foreign concept to the Messianic kingdom in Old Testament prophecy. Isaiah described it in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=9#Future" target="_blank" title="Isaiah 54 Summary">Isaiah 54:14-15 (see notes)</a>, &quot;In righteousness you shall be established; You shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear; And from terror, for it shall not come near you. Indeed they shall surely assemble, but not because of Me. Whoever assembles against you shall fall for your sake.&quot; There, Isaiah references the existence of an enemy during the Messianic kingdom, but one that is not able to harm the righteous inhabitants.</p>

<p>We see a reference to &quot;Gog and Magog&quot; in verse 8. In <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=1#Top" target="_blank" title="Ezekiel 38-39 Summary">Ezekiel 38-39 (see notes)</a> we see this enemy as specific countries that ally with others to attack Jerusalem during the tribulation. However, here in verse 8 they undoubtedly represent a composite of the worldwide enemies of Christ at the end of the millennium inasmuch as they are gathered from the <font size="3">&quot;four corners of the earth</font>&quot; to do this battle. There is no indication in this passage that this rebellion consists of any Jews. Per the New Covenant of <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=30#Covenant" target="_blank" title="Jeremiah 31 Summary">Jeremiah 31:31-34 (see notes)</a>, we can safely assume that this 1,000-year period begins that specified relationship between God and the Jewish people.</p>

<p><strong>There are three reasons why we know this rebellion consists of Gentiles:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Israel will be living under the New Covenant of <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=30#Covenant" target="_blank" title="Jeremiah 31 Summary">Jeremiah 31:31-34 (see notes)</a> where all Jews will know the Lord.</li>
	<li>The Greek word for &quot;nations&quot; in verse 3 is &quot;ethnos&quot; which is used in the New Testament as a reference to non-Jewish people.</li>
	<li>These rebels are described in verse 8 as &quot;God and Magog.&quot; These are references to the Gentile enemies of God.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice in verse 10 that Satan will be finally &quot;cast into the lake of fire and brimstone.&quot; This is Satan&#39;s final non-resting place, and it is NOT climate controlled. More company follows - seen in verses 11-15 as a result of the white throne judgment.</p>

<p><a name="White"></a><font size="4"><b>White Throne Judgment (Revelation 20:11-15)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">11 &para; Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them.<br />
12 And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.<br />
13 The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.<br />
14 Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<br />
15 And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>White Throne Judgment - sounds pretty, doesn&#39;t it? Unfortunately, this is where the wicked dead are judged just prior to being cast into the Lake of Fire. <b>The book described here is the Lamb&#39;s book of life - a compilation containing all who have ever been saved. This is the only basis for going to Heaven; verse 15 says so, &quot;And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.&quot;</b> So...what about the books in verse 12? Obviously from the context of verses 12 and 13 <b>these books contain a list of the works of lost people.</b> Why? If they&#39;re going to the Lake of Fire anyway for lack of having their names written in the book of life, what difference do their works make? I can only offer an educated guess here, but I think there must be different degrees of punishment in the Lake of Fire, thus making the works of even these lost people significant. It&#39;s just a guess though. It does seem reasonable, however, that someone like Hitler should receive more severe punishment after death than others. Incidentally, this is one of six judgments concerning mankind. <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Judgments.html" target="_blank" title="Six Judgments">Click here for an understanding of all six.</a></p>

<p>To lend support of the notion that the &quot;works&quot; of lost people will have some bearing on the eventual outcome, though in the Lake of Fire, for those present at the White Throne Judgment, consider <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=8&amp;dy=13#Judgment" target="_blank" title="Romans 2 Summary">Romans 2:1-11 (see notes)</a>. Specifically, verses 5-6 in that chapter say, &quot; But in accordance with your hardness and your impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who &#39;will render to each one according to his deeds&#39;:&quot; There we see that, though without Christ, their works will have some bearing on the results of their appearance before the White Throne Judgment.</p>

<p>Verse 13 lists three places of confinement for the unsaved dead, the sea, death and hades/hell. This distinction would appear to be for the purpose of making certain the reader understands this to be all of the dead without Christ - not to create a doctrine of three distinct holding places for the dead without Christ. No such distinction can be validated elsewhere in scripture. It is likely that the distinction made here is related to the outcome of the event which immediately precedes the White Throne judgment - the Gog/Magog rebellion. There appears to be no lapse of time between the destruction of the Gentile aggressors and their appearance before the White Throne judgment. It makes sense, therefore, that these &quot;death&quot; and &quot;sea&quot; people are the ones who did not spend one millisecond in hades/hell, but were transported from their point of destruction immediately to appear before Jesus for judgment. So, these would have spent NO time in hades/hell.</p>

<p>You will notice from verse 14 that <b>hades/hell is also cast into the lake of fire.</b> If you followed the link above on <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=6&amp;dy=22#Curtain" target="_blank" title="Matthew 27 Summary">Matthew 27:52-53 (see notes)</a> and <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=10&amp;dy=08#Ephesians" target="_blank" title="Ephesians 4 Summary">Ephesians 4:8-10 (see notes)</a>, then you read <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=2&amp;dy=14#Sign" target="_blank" title="Matthew 12 Summary">Matthew 12:40 (see notes)</a>, &quot;For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&quot; <b>Then and now, hades/hell is located at the center of the earth according to Jesus.</b> At the end of the millennium, according to verse 14, it will be removed from &quot;the heart of the earth&quot; and cast into the lake of fire. The reason? This sphere we currently inhabit called earth will be destroyed at the end of the millennium to make way for a new earth.</p>

<p><strong>Let&#39;s take note of the eternal inhabitants of the Lake of Fire according to scripture:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Wicked Jews</strong> - according to <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=5&amp;dy=21#Expand" target="_blank" title="Matthew 25 Summary">Matthew 25:14-30 (see notes)</a><br />
	Matthew 25:30, &quot;And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Wicked Gentiles...and demons</strong> - according to <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=5&amp;dy=21#Tribulation" target="_blank" title="Matthew 25 Summary">Matthew 25:31-46 (see notes)</a><br />
	Matthew 25:41, &quot;Then He will also say to those on the left hand, &#39;Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels:&#39;&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>The Beast and False prophet</strong><br />
	<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=27#Armageddon" target="_blank" title="Revelation 19 Summary">Revelation 19:20 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Satan</strong><br />
	Revelation 20:10 (<a href="#Millennium">see above</a>), &quot;The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>All of the wicked since the creation of the world</strong> - per the white throne judgment shown here in verses 11-15</li>

</blockquote>

<p>Up through the judgment of Revelation 20:11-15 (<a href="#White">see above</a>), the earth referred to is the same earth that we inhabit today, the one created in Genesis. At the end of that passage, <b>Hell is removed from the center of the earth and cast into the lake of fire.</b> At that time, the wicked dead are cast directly into the lake of fire. Revelation 21:1 tells us of a new Heaven and new Earth that will be created immediately following the millennium. <b>There are no unrighteous people on the new earth, nor will there ever be from that time forward.</b> Satan will have been permanently banished to the lake of fire, and the old earth creation will have been destroyed. Only righteousness will prevail throughout eternity.</p>

<p>Isaiah prophesied of a new heaven, a new earth and a newly created Jerusalem. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to see a distinct line in his prophecy between the millennium and this recreation. He apparently saw aspects of each in the same vision in<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=10#Israel" target="_blank" title="Isaiah 60 Summary"> Isaiah 60 (see notes)</a> and <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=11#Remnant" target="_blank" title="Isaiah 65 Summary">Isaiah 65-66 (see notes)</a>. In the Old Testament, conditions of the Millennium and conditions of the New Earth are not clearly differentiated.</p>

<p>Verse 2 speaks of a new Jerusalem; we get some detail on this holy city beginning in verse 10. This supernatural city descends from Heaven and contains the Bride of Christ; Jesus is the husband. All the descriptions people generally associate with Heaven are really descriptions of the New Jerusalem. We are told in verse 3 that God will dwell with man from this point forward. Let&#39;s be clear: This is a physical reign over the New Earth. Here&#39;s where we find the permanent Messianic reign of Jesus, and only saved people will exist on the earth. Those with glorified bodies will be at home in the New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Verse 4 differentiates this period from any other when it says, &quot;And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.&quot; We see in verses 7-8 that only righteous will dwell with God from this point forward while all others (verse 8) will dwell in the lake of fire.</p>

<p><a name="Jerusalem"></a><font size="4"><b>And a new Jerusalem too (Revelation 21:9-27)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">9 &para; Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, &ldquo;Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;<br />
10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,<br />
11 having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.<br />
12 Also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:<br />
13 three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.<br />
14 &para; Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<br />
15 And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.<br />
16 The city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.<br />
17 Then he measured its wall: one hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.<br />
18 The construction of its wall was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.<br />
19 The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,<br />
20 the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.<br />
21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.<br />
22 &para; But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.<br />
23 The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light.<br />
24 And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it.<br />
25 Its gates shall not be shut at all by day (there shall be no night there).<br />
26 And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.<br />
27 But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s Book of Life. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Verse 9 speaks of &quot;the bride, the Lamb&rsquo;s wife.&quot; Of course, the groom is Jesus, &quot;the Lamb.&quot; The &quot;bride&quot; is a collective term referring to all of those who have trusted Jesus Christ as Savior. <b>The New Jerusalem is a cube - a huge cube, 1,400 miles to each side.</b> That&#39;s a different living concept than usual - one that&#39;s particularly suited to people with glorified bodies like ourselves. Verse 27 tells us that only perfect people will live there - people who have been washed in the blood of the lamb - SAVED PEOPLE!</p>

<p>It is obvious from this passage that the Messiah (Jesus) rules from New Jerusalem and that Believers, the &quot;bride&quot; dwell there as well. Paul portrays the church as the bride of Christ in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=8#Husband" target="_blank" title="Ephesians 5 Summary">Ephesians 5:25-33 (see notes)</a>. In <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=5&amp;dy=21#Supper" target="_blank" title="Matthew 25 Summary">Matthew 25:1-13 (see notes)</a> we see ten virgins; these are bride attendants...Jews who enter into the millennium from the tribulation without dying.</p>

<p>We see in verses 12-14 that a wall surrounds the area where the city is situated. In verses 15-17 we see that the wall has twelve gates - each with an angel, named after the twelve tribes of Israel. The twelve foundations of the wall are named after the twelve Apostles of Christ. The wall is 144 cubits high...about 216 feet. We see some interesting building materials here in verses 18-21: The wall around the city is made of jasper. The city is made of transparent gold...streets too, and the foundation of precious stones...the gates of pearls. Who wouldn&#39;t want to live there!</p>

<p>Notice a few unusual features about the New Jerusalem: <b>No night, no sun, no moon - Jesus is the light.</b> And there&#39;s <b>no temple</b> there either. Ezekiel&#39;s temple (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=2#Temple" target="_blank" title="Ezekiel 40-41 Summary">Ezekiel 40-41, see notes</a>) is part of the old earth during the millennium which is gone at this point in time. <b>Sacrifices will be made at that temple during the millennium as a memorial of salvation through Jesus Christ</b> (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=1&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=3#Altar" target="_blank" title="Ezekiel 43 Summary">Ezekiel 43, see notes</a>)<b>, but not on the new earth or in the new Jerusalem</b> according to Revelation 21:22, &quot;But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.&quot; It should be noted that this marks a period substantially different from that of the millennium which precedes it. Jesus still reigns as Messiah, but there are no provisions from here to eternity for the existence of unregenerate people as there were during the millennium.</p>

<p>This passage, along with <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=11#Remnant" target="_blank" title="Isaiah 65 Summary">Isaiah 65-66 (see notes)</a>, indicates that there will be other earth dwellers as well (verses 24-26), in addition to those who dwell in New Jerusalem. Verse 27 indicates once again that there will be no unregenerate people located there.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Finally"></a>And finally... (Revelation 22)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">1 And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb.<br />
2 In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.<br />
3 And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him.<br />
4 They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.<br />
5 There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.<br />
6 &para; Then he said to me, &ldquo;These words are faithful and true.&rdquo; And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show His servants the things which must shortly take place.<br />
7 &para; &ldquo;Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.&rdquo;<br />
8 &para; Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.<br />
9 &para; Then he said to me, &ldquo;See that you do not do that. For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.&rdquo;<br />
10 And he said to me, &ldquo;Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand.<br />
11 He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still.&rdquo;<br />
12 &para; &ldquo;And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work.<br />
13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last.&rdquo;<br />
14 &para; Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city.<br />
15 But outside are dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and practices a lie.<br />
16 &para; &ldquo;I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star.&rdquo;<br />
17 &para; And the Spirit and the bride say, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; And let him who hears say, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely.<br />
18 &para; For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book;<br />
19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.<br />
20 &para; He who testifies to these things says, &ldquo;Surely I am coming quickly.&rdquo; &para; Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!<br />
21 &para; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The description of the New Jerusalem continues from chapter 21 in verses 1-5 here. From the throne proceeds a &quot;pure river of water of life.&quot; The tree of life there keeps everyone healed, and there will be no more curse on the earth. Moreover, all are in Christ. Incidentally, notice that God will provide the light for everyone. This state of perfection is eternal.</p>

<p>John begins closing his prophecy in verse 6. We are told that John&#39;s Revelation has the same authority as the prophecies of the Old Testament prophets. The imminent appearing of Jesus Christ is to be anticipated. The Greek verb for &quot;keeps&quot; (verse 7) is &quot;tereo&quot; which means &quot;to guard.&quot; In other words, we are to guard the Book of Revelation.</p>

<p>In verses 8-9, we see that John has an inclination to worship the angel messenger. The angel proclaims that only God is to be worshiped. In verse 10, John is told by the angel that this prophecy is not to be kept private. At the time of the completion of this prophecy, the spiritual state of all will remain unchanged throughout eternity. The words &ldquo;unjust&rdquo; and &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; are opposites of the same Greek root - &ldquo;dikaios&rdquo; The word &ldquo;holy&rdquo; means &ldquo;set apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In verse 12, the judgment seat of Christ is referenced. The ones &ldquo;who do his commandments&rdquo; in verse 14 are Believers. John defines them as such <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=3#Love" target="_blank" title="I John 3 Summary">I John 3:23 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave us commandment.&quot; Those &ldquo;without&rdquo; (verse 15) are the lost.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a close look at verse 16. This prophecy is directed to &quot;the churches.&quot; Jesus is the &ldquo;root&rdquo; (Greek: rhiza) and the &ldquo;offspring&rdquo; (Greek: genos &ndash; family, race, kind) of David. The Messianic promise through David is seen in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=6&amp;dy=19#Temple" target="_blank" title="II Samuel 7 Summary">II Samuel 7:12-16 (see notes)</a>. At this point in time, all will have been fulfilled.</p>

<p>Verse 17 is an invitation to salvation for all who will trust Jesus Christ as Savior. And then a warning in verses 18-19, &quot;Don&#39;t mess with the contents of the Book of Revelation!&quot; It is what it is - a revelation of the end that is progressively illuminated to us as we approach the end of this dispensation. As time passes, more and more of this prophecy is specifically manifested to us as we see current events fall into place.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>As someone notably said, &quot;I read the end of the Book, and we win!&quot;</b></font></p>
