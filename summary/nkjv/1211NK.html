	<p><font size="4"><b>John gets a revelation from God</b></font><br>Revelation was written by John on Patmos - the result of a vision around 95 A.D. It is, indeed, the last book written. According to the tradition of the early church writer, Eusebius, John was on the island as a result of being exiled there by the Roman emperor. All we know about it from the scripture is found in verse 9, &quot;I, John, both your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.&quot; There wasn't much to do on the island except commune with God. It's in this setting that John receives the words of the Book of Revelation.</p>
  <p><font size="4"><b><a name="Introduction"></a>The introduction to the rest of the prophecy (Revelation 1)</b></font><br>
		</p>
<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants&mdash;things which must shortly take place. And He sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John, <br>
		    2 who bore witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw. <br>
		    3 Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near. <br>
		    4 &para; John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: &para; Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, <br>
		    5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. &para; To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, <br>
		    6 and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. <br>
		    7 &para; Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him. Even so, Amen. <br>
		    8 &para; &ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End,&rdquo; says the Lord, &ldquo;who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.&rdquo;<br>
		    9 &para; I, John, both your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. <br>
		    10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet, <br>
		    11 saying, &ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.&rdquo;<br>
		    12 &para; Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands, <br>
		    13 and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band. <br>
		    14 His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire; <br>
		    15 His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters; <br>
		    16 He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength. <br>
		    17 And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last.<br>
		    18 I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death.<br>
		    19 Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after this.<br>
	      20 The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.</font></p>

	<p><b><img src="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/image/Seven_churches.jpg" alt="The Seven Churches of Revelation 2-3" height="247" width="300" align="right" border="0">John introduces in verses 1-3 the purpose for writing down this prophecy.</b> He then names his initial audience, the seven churches in Asia, a Roman province embracing the greater part of western Asia Minor. Today these locations are found in modern-day Turkey. Patmos, the island from which John is writing, is off the coast. <b>The order of the churches is always listed the same. Notice the map provided here and observe that the order of listing is clockwise from the nearest one to Patmos (Ephesus), around, and back down towards Patmos.</b></p>
		<p>The testimony that John is recording is that of Jesus Christ (verse 2). John records what he saw from the angel of verse 2. Here's a rephrase of verse 3 that captures the essence of the Greek usage of the three present active participles used in that verse, &quot;Blessed are <strong>the ones reading</strong> and <strong>the ones hearing</strong> the words of the prophecy and <strong>the ones guarding</strong> [in] the same having been written. For the time is near.&quot; John tells us, as Believers, how we are to regard the Book of Revelation: Read, hear and guard its words.</p>
		<p><strong>Verse 5 gives us the following facts about Jesus Christ:</strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Jesus is &quot;the faithful witness.&quot;<br>
		  Greek &quot;pistos&quot; means faithful, trustworthy, reliable.</li>
          <li>Jesus is &quot;the firstborn from the dead.&quot;<br>
            In <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=16#Who" title="Colossians 1 Summary" target="_blank">Colossians 1:15 (see notes)</a> Paul says of Jesus, &quot;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.&quot;<br>
          In <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=10#Corinthians" title="I Corinthians 15 Summary" target="_blank">I Corinthians 15:23 (see notes)</a> Paul said, &quot;But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming.&quot;<br>
          Paul describes Jesus in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=17#What" title="Romans 8 Summary" target="_blank">Romans 8:29 (see notes)</a>, &quot;For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.&quot;<br>
          Jesus' resurrection from the dead establishes the precedent for all Believers to follow. This concept, while used by Paul in his epistles, originates from <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=6&dy=17#Note" title="Psalm 89 Summary" target="_blank">Psalm 89 (see notes)</a>. Psalm 89:27 says, &quot;Also I will make him My firstborn, 	The highest of the kings of the earth.&quot;</li>
	      <li>Jesus is &quot;ruler over the kings of the earth.&quot;<br>
	      This is obviously another reference to Psalm 89:27.</li>
	      <li>Jesus &quot;loved us.&quot;</li>
	      <li>Jesus &quot;washed us from our sins in His own blood.&quot;<br>
	      This is our spiritual rebirth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's not miss the declaration in verse 6 of the position before God of all Believers, &quot;<font size="3">and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father</font>...&quot; We also see this doctrine of the priesthood of Believers in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=25#Who" title="I Peter 2 Summary" target="_blank">I Peter 2:9 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people...&quot; This being the case, those in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=31#Millennium" title="Revelation 20 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 20:6 (see notes)</a> who &quot;<font size="3">shall reign with Him a thousand years&quot;</font> certainly must be a reference to all Believers.</p>
	<p>Verse 7 is often misunderstood when it says, &quot;Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him. Even so, Amen.&quot; That's not the rapture of <a title="I Thessalonians 4 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=20#Rapture" target="_blank">I Thessalonians 4:13-18 (see notes)</a> and <a title="I Corinthians 15 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=10#Mystery" target="_blank">I Corinthians 15:51-58 (see notes)</a>; that's the second coming of <a title="Revelation 19 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=27#Armageddon" target="_blank">Revelation 19:11-21 (see notes)</a>. Yes, I'm aware that Believers meet the Lord in the clouds in I Thessalonians 4:17, but all the criteria found in the verse are not met until the Battle of Armageddon. <a title="Revelation 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=15#Life" target="_blank">Click here to see the notes on Revelation 6 for additional clarifications.</a></p>
	<p title="Daniel 7 Summary"><b>It is obvious that Jesus Christ himself is giving John this prophecy from the description seen here (verses 11-18).</b> <strong>Notice the similarity here with <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=12#Daniel" target="_blank">Daniel 7:9-10</a></strong><a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=12#Daniel"> (see notes)</a><strong>:</strong></p>

	<p>We see a three-point outline of the prophecy in verse 19, &quot;Write <strong>the things which you have seen</strong>, and <strong>the things which are</strong>, and <strong>the things which will take place after this.</strong>&quot; In addition to what John has seen in verse 1-18, he is told to write about &quot;the things which are.&quot; <b>This is a reference to the spiritual situation in the seven churches listed in Asia Minor in John's day. We'll see those situations in chapters 2-3.</b> The future (&quot;the things which will take place after this&quot;) begins in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=15#Heaven" title="Revelation 4 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 4 (see notes)</a> and continues on to the end of the book.</p>
	<p>The &quot;seven stars&quot; and &quot;seven lampstands&quot; are identified in verse 20 - &quot;The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.&quot; References will be made to these identifiers in chapters 2-3. The Greek word for &quot;angel&quot; (&quot;aggelos&quot;) is also frequently translated &quot;messenger.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>An introduction to Revelation chapters 2 and 3<br>
				</b></font><font size="3"><b>There is no prophecy in Revelation 2-3. </b></font>John's vision contains instructions for these seven churches in Asia Minor. These were real churches in that day. <b>Some have taken these seven churches to be church-age prophecy, with each of the seven churches mentioned representing a period of time beginning in the first century all the way down to our current day.</b> In this extra-scriptural systematic assignment of Asia Minor churches to periods of church history, we are considered to be living in the Laodicean church age now in the 21st century. <b>Here's the problem though; there's nothing in this passage or any other to suggest that these church exhortations are to be taken as anything more than exhortations to those actual seven churches in Asia Minor.</b> So, I am convinced that our lesson here is to look at the attributes of these churches and identify the ones God does and does not honor...and to heed them. Remember, these are churches - local assemblies being referenced here. <b>I do not see any basis whatsoever to identify these two chapters as an analogous message outlining the characteristics of seven ages of church history.</b></p>
		<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Ephesus"></a>The church at Ephesus (Revelation 2:1-7)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;To the angel of the church of Ephesus write, &para; &lsquo;These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:<br>
		    2 &ldquo;I know your works, your labor, your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them liars;<br>
		    3 and you have persevered and have patience, and have labored for My name&rsquo;s sake and have not become weary.<br>
		    4 Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.<br>
		    5 Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place&mdash;unless you repent.<br>
		    6 But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.<br>
	      7 &para; &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Paul had previously visited there on his <a title="Second Missiionary Journey " href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=24#Happy" target="_blank">second missionary journey</a> in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=24#Happy" title="Acts 18 Summary" target="_blank">Acts 18:19-21 (see notes)</a>, then again on his <a title="Third Missionary Journey" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=28#Corinth" target="_blank">third missionary journey</a> (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=28#Corinth" title="Acts 19-20 Summary" target="_blank">Acts 19:8-10; 20:31, see notes</a>), when he remained there for two years preaching in the synagogue (Acts 19:8,10), in the school of Tyrannus (Acts 19:9) and in private houses (Acts 20:20). Diana's temple was there, making it a pagan religious center for all of Asia. <b>The Ephesians are commended for their patience, perseverance and intolerance for false teachers.</b> Their problem is having <b>left their first love.</b> It would appear that they had <b>lost site of their purpose and love for Christ</b> and were merely going through the actions - <b>proper actions, but with improper motivation.</b> The removal of a lampstand in these two chapters is symbolic of a church becoming dead. It has no reference whatsoever to the salvation of individual believers. </p>
		<p>Here's John's admonition to them in verse 5: Remember what the old days were like and return to them. Repent (Greek: metanoeo) means to change one's mind or attitude. The Ephesians needed an attitude adjustment.</p>
		<p>Several theories have been offered regarding who the Nicolaitans were; many scholars believe that they were a <a title="Gnosticism" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Gnosticism.html" target="_blank">gnostic group (see Gnosticism)</a> originally founded by a man named Nicolaus, but we really have no direct evidence to validate such. It is assumed that they were a sect who preached false doctrine. Whoever they are, let's stay clear of them.</p>
		<p><a name="Overcomers"></a>Verse 7 is interesting. Let's define to whom &quot;him who overcomes&quot; refers. John wrote in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=3#Test" title="I John 5 Summary" target="_blank">I John 5:4-5 (see notes)</a>, &quot;For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world&mdash;our faith. Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?&quot; So, John uses this phrase to describe Believers. The &quot;tree of life&quot; is a reference, first of all, to the one that was located in the Garden of Eden (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=1&dy=2#Life" title="Genesis 2 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 2:9, see notes</a>). After Adam's sin, God drove them out of the Garden of Eden because, according to <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=1&dy=2#News" title="Genesis 3 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 3:22 (see notes)</a>, &quot;...lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.&quot; The fruit of that tree of life was apparently the means whereby God had granted them eternal life. We see in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=31#Finally" title="Revelation 22 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 22 (see notes)</a> that, after the creation of the New Earth, there will once again exist the &quot;tree of life.&quot; Revelation 22:2 says that it will exist there &quot;for the healing of the nations.&quot; Therefore, access to the &quot;tree of life&quot; guarantees eternal life.</p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>The church at Smyrna (Revelation 2:8-11)</b></font><br>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">8 &para; &ldquo;And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write, &para; &lsquo;These things says the First and the Last, who was dead, and came to life:<br>
	    9 &ldquo;I know your works, tribulation, and poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.<br>
	    10 Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.<br>
      11 &para; &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Smyrna was a modern city with wide paved roads along with Roman and pagan temples. It was a center for medicine and science. The church there was probably founded while Paul was in and around Ephesus for approximately 2 years around 57 A.D. while on his <a title="Third Missionary Journey" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=28#Corinth" target="_blank">third missionary journey</a> (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=28#Corinth" title="Acts 19-20 Summary" target="_blank">Acts 19:8-10; 20:31, see notes</a>). Smyrna was close to Ephesus. There is no direct mention of them in Paul's third missionary journey, but he would have passed through on his way north.</p>
	<p>There are only two churches in this list of seven about which nothing critical is said. This is the first. Commendations for their works and suffering can be inferred here in verse 9. Apparently there were people in Smyrna presenting themselves as Jewish converts to Christianity, but were doing so falsely. No additional information is available.</p>
	<p>In verse 10, the &quot;devil&quot; (Greek: diabolos) means slanderer, but when used with the definite article (as here) usually means Satan himself. The &quot;tribulation ten days&quot; is a mystery...maybe a figure of speech. We see that death as a martyr brings a &quot;crown of life.&quot;</p>
	<p>Tough times are ahead for these people, but they are commended for their faithfulness. Overcomers are defined by John as Believers in his first epistle (<a href="#Overcomers">see note above</a>). The &quot;second death&quot; is described by John in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=31#White" title="Revelation 20 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 20:14 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.&quot;</p>
	<p><a name="Pergamos"></a><font size="4"><b>The church at Pergamos (Revelation 2:12-17)</b></font><br>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">12 &para; &ldquo;And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, &para; &lsquo;These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword:<br>
	    13 &ldquo;I know your works, and where you dwell, where Satan&rsquo;s throne is. And you hold fast to My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.<br>
	    14 But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.<br>
	    15 Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.<br>
	    16 Repent, or else I will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth.<br>
      17 &para; &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except him who receives it.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Pergamos was about 15 miles inland and hosted three temples dedicated to Roman Emperors where they were worshipped as gods - one to Augustus Caesar. Pergamos was a religious center for that region. The &quot;Imperial Cult&quot; was a test of loyalty to Rome. Jews had integrated into Roman society there.</p>
	<p>Well, these folks had been faithful to the name of Christ, but that's about it on the good side. &quot;Satan's seat&quot; might be a reference to the three temples built to the Roman emperors located there. Despite being a religious center, they remained firm for Christ and became marked as not loyal to Rome. An unknown martyr, Antipas, was slain there.</p>
	<p>Verse 14 resurrects some Old Testament memories. You will recall that Balaam devised a plan whereby the daughters of the Moabites would seduce the Israelite men and lead them to sacrifice to their god Baal-peor in Numbers 25. You may also want to take a look at <a title="II Peter 2 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=29#God" target="_blank">II Peter 2:15-16 (see notes)</a> and <a title="Jude 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=7#Warning" target="_blank">Jude 11 (see notes)</a> which also refer back to Numbers 25. <a title="Numbers 22 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=3&dy=25#Og" target="_blank">(Click here to learn more regarding the events of Numbers 22-25.)</a> It would appear that there were those in the church there who tempted the Believers with sinful practices in the same fashion as did Balaam. </p>
	<p>The Nicolaitans again get dishonorable mention here as they did regarding Ephesus (<a href="#Ephesus">see above</a>). There seemed to be a good bit of deviant doctrine inside the church. They must repent.</p>
	<p>In verse 16, repent (Greek: metanoeo) means to change one's mind or attitude. In verse 17, the manna is a reference to the Old Testament wilderness wandering (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=16#Stuff" title="Exodus 16 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 16, see notes</a>). The &quot;white stone&quot; is a mystery.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>The church at Thyatira (Revelation 2:18-29)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">18 &para; &ldquo;And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, &para; &lsquo;These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass:<br>
    19 &ldquo;I know your works, love, service, faith, and your patience; and as for your works, the last are more than the first.<br>
    20 Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.<br>
    21 And I gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent.<br>
    22 Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.<br>
    23 I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.<br>
    24 &para; &ldquo;Now to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I will put on you no other burden.<br>
    25 But hold fast what you have till I come.<br>
    26 And he who overcomes, and keeps My works until the end, to him I will give power over the nations&mdash;<br>
    27 	&ldquo;He shall rule them with a rod of iron;<br>
They shall be dashed to pieces like the potter&rsquo;s vessels&rsquo;&mdash;as I also have received from My Father;<br>
28 and I will give him the morning star.<br>

<p>Thyatira was a city of craftsmen and merchants. Lydia, a convert of Paul in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=24#Lydia" title="Acts 16 Summary" target="_blank">Acts 16:11-15 (see notes)</a>, was a seller of purple fabric there. We are told from secular sources that many trade guilds operated in Thyatira. The city hosted a major cult of Apollo, son of Zeus - the deity associated with prophecy and the sun.</p>
<p>These folks are commended in verse 19 for their &quot;works, love, service, faith, and your patience.&quot; However, they had a problem...big problem. Jezebel may not have been her actual name. It could have been the tag given her by Christ in this passage because of her dastardly deeds. My rule of thumb has always been this: <b>Being called Jezebel is never a compliment. </b>She had obviously corrupted this church with false teaching accompanied apparently with a teaching of cultic immorality (verses 21-24). In addition to the words of this passage, that notion is based upon the showdown between Elijah, Jezebel and her band of heathen prophets of Baal. <a title="I Kings 18-19 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=08&dy=26" target="_blank">It's a great read in I Kings 18-19 when you have time.</a> This church gets a one-sentence commendation in verse 19, but it's all downhill from there. <b>If they don't repent, severe judgment is on the way.</b></p>
<p>There is a reference to ruling in verse 26. Apparently saints will rule over the nations with Christ. Faithfulness here is rewarded with responsibility during the millennium over Gentile nations. We don't have any additional details regarding the &quot;morning star&quot; of verse 28.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>The church at Sardis (Revelation 3:1-6)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;And to the angel of the church in Sardis write, &para; &ldquo;These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: &lsquo;I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.<br>
    2 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found your works perfect before God.<br>
    3 Remember therefore how you have received and heard; hold fast and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.<br>
    4 You have a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.<br>
    5 He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.<br>
  6 &para; &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's what we know about Sardis from history. It was a very old city, well fortified on top of a mountain. It had been conquered by the Persians in the 6th century B.C. and Greeks in the 3rd century B.C. This modern city maintained a temple to the Greek goddess Artemis. Sardis also had a well-established Jewish population. Of all the seven churches, this one receives the most criticism.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to a church and said, &quot;This church is dead!&quot;? Well, that's the description of Sardis. The message to this congregation is, &quot;Wake up!&quot; There were a few in the church who were still perky as we see in verse 4. <b>Let the revival form around them!</b> &quot;Repent&quot; (Greek: metanoeo) means to change one's mind or attitude.</p>
<p>Incidentally, verse 5 has been abused by those who teach that salvation is temporary - only effective as long as one is actively serving God. They abuse this verse with very poor deductive reasoning in assuming that the inverse is true - that if one does not overcome his name will be blotted out of the book of life. Ironically, verse 5 actually provides a very strong case for the security of the Believer and is not intended as a threat at all. Those referenced overcame to salvation, shall be clothed in white raiment and, thus, are eternally secure. That's the exact context in which John uses the term in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=3#Test" title="I John 5 Summary" target="_blank">I John 5:4-5 (see notes)</a>, &quot;For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world&mdash;our faith. Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?&quot; So, John uses this phrase to describe Believers.</p>

    8 &ldquo;I know your works. See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have a little strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name.<br>

<p>Philadelphia was located about 90 miles inland on the Hermus River, a river that connected to the Mediterranean. It was often referred to as &ldquo;Little Athens&rdquo; because of the magnificent buildings and pagan temples located there. The city had a significant population of Jews who maintained a synagogue there.</p>
<p><b>Only this church and Smyrna have no indictments against them.</b> Apparently they were being attacked by those impostors mentioned in verse 9. The Philadelphians are told, &quot;Just hang on; your day is coming!&quot;</p>
<p>There's an interesting reference in verse 7 regarding the opening and closing. Jesus is the &quot;holy and true&quot; one here. Here's a quote from <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=21#Prophecy" title="Isaiah 22 Summary" target="_blank">Isaiah 22:22 (see notes)</a>, &quot;The key of the house of David 	I will lay on his shoulder; 	So he shall open, and no one shall shut; 	And he shall shut, and no one shall open.&quot;  In Hezekiah's reign, Shebna was replaced by Eliakim because Shebna's interests were not loyal to the security of Jerusalem against the Assyrians. Shebna was NOT holy and true. Though spiritually beaten down, the folks in Philadelphia remained faithful and true. According to John's definition (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=3#Test" title="I John 5 Summary" target="_blank">I John 5:4-5, see notes</a>), overcomers are Believers (<a href="#Overcomers">see note above for more details</a>). All of the details regarding the New Jerusalem are found in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=31#New" title="Revelation 21-22 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 21-22 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>The church at Laodicea (Revelation 3:14-22)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">14 &para; &ldquo;And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, &para; &lsquo;These things says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God:<br>
    15 &ldquo;I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I could wish you were cold or hot.<br>
    16 So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth.<br>
    17 Because you say, &ldquo;I am rich, have become wealthy, and have need of nothing&rsquo;&mdash;and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked&mdash;<br>
    18 I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.<br>
    19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent.<br>

<p><strong>The Laodiceans - there is not a single positive comment about these folks here.</strong></p>
<p><b>There's kind of an interesting play on words concerning these Laodiceans.</b> They piped their water through enclosed conduits for several miles to the city. As a result, their water was lukewarm. These people understood, &quot;lukewarm.&quot; Thus, their works are compared to lukewarm water - not that good; not that bad - just lukewarm. Is God happy with a lukewarm church? Obviously not (verse 16)! However, they thought they were okay according to verse 17, but not so according to verse 18. </p>
<p>An interesting linkage is made in that verse regarding the trade resources of the city of Laodicea. It was a banking center, whose banks even Cicero recommended for exchanging money; it manufactured clothing and wool carpets, made from the glossy black wool of sheep raised locally; it also had a medical school and produced a popular eye ointment made from a pulverized rock found in the area. Now look at verse 18 in that context, &quot;I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.&quot; Interesting stuff, huh? </p>
<p>The &quot;Amen&quot; (verse 14) is a transliteration of the Greek meaning &ldquo;trustworthy.&rdquo; We also see the eternal presence of Jesus emphasized, just as it was by John in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=1&dy=1#Deity" title="John 1 Summary" target="_blank">John 1:1,14 (see notes)</a>. Notice the reference to chastisement in verse 19. Why? Because he loves them. That would indicate that these &quot;neither cold nor hot&quot; folks were Believers. God chastens Believers according to <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=17#Chastisement" title="Hebrews 12 Summary" target="_blank">Hebrews 12:6-8 (see notes)</a>, &quot;For whom the LORD loves He chastens, 	And scourges every son whom He receives. If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten? But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons.&quot; That phrase, &quot;as many as I love,&quot; establishes that these are &quot;lukewarm&quot; Believers being addressed here and encouraged to &quot;repent&quot; (Greek: metanoeo i.e. change one's mind or attitude).</p>
<p>An appeal is made in verse 20 for the local assembly to invite Christ back in. <b>Works done in a church by the empowerment of the Holy Spirit are not lukewarm; they are HOT! </b>Let's look closely at Revelation 3:20, &quot;Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.&quot; Some use this verse as a call to personal salvation. For personal salvation, the knocking-on-the-door metaphor just makes a nice presentation when presenting the Gospel message. <b>This verse, though technically directed to individual Laodiceans to once again establish fellowship with Christ, does make a rather nice salvation invitation. However, that does do a bit of injustice to the context here.</b></p>
<p>According to John's definition (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=3#Test" title="I John 5 Summary" target="_blank">I John 5:4-5, see notes</a>), overcomers (verse 21) are Believers (<a href="#Overcomers">see note above for more details</a>). After the rapture of the church indicated in  <a title="I Thessalonians 4 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=20#Rapture" target="_blank">I Thessalonians 4:13-18 (see notes)</a> and <a title="I Corinthians 15 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=10#Mystery" target="_blank">I Corinthians 15:51-58 (see notes)</a>, we are told in I Thessalonians 4:17, &quot;...And thus we shall always be with the Lord.&quot; Of course, we'll be ruling with Christ.</p>
