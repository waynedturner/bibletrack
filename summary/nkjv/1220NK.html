3 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the LORD:<br>

4 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts:<br>
&lsquo;Old men and old women shall again sit<br>

There were no wages for man nor any hire for beast;<br>
There was no peace from the enemy for whoever went out or came in;<br>

<p>This discussion of fasting began back in <a title="Zechariah 7 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=18#Fast" target="_blank">Zechariah 7 (see notes)</a>. Here in chapter 8 we get the answer about continued observance of the self-imposed days of fasting. </p>
<p><strong>Verse 19 tells us there were four of these fasts observed by these who had once been exiled. Here they are: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The fast of the fourth month was for the breach of Jerusalem's walls (<a title="Jeremiah 39 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=3#Falls" target="_blank">Jeremiah 39:2, see notes</a>). </li>
  <li>The fifth-month fast was for the temple destruction (<a title="II Kings 25 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=4#Nebuchadnezzar" target="_blank">II Kings 25:8, see notes</a>). </li>
  <li>The seventh-month fast was for the slaying of Gedaliah (<a title="II Kings 25 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=4#Nebuchadnezzar" target="_blank">II Kings 25:25, see notes</a>).</li>
  <li>The tenth-month fast marked the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar's siege on Jerusalem (<a title="II Kings 25 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=4#Nebuchadnezzar" target="_blank">II Kings 25:1-2, see notes</a>).</li>
  </ul>
<p><b>What we see in this chapter is an establishment of celebration for the returning exiles in 535 B.C. Those fasts are turned into feasts instead.</b> </p>
<p><b>Notice the prophecy in verses 7-8 concerning the regathering of Israel:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>7  &ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts:<br>
&lsquo;Behold, I will save My people from the land of the east<br>
And from the land of the west; <br>
8 	I will bring them back,<br>
And they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem.<br>
They shall be My people<br>
And I will be their God,<br>
In truth and righteousness.&rsquo; </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Here's the question. <b>Do these verses reference the regathering of these exiles which began in 535 B.C., or another regathering later on?</b> Some would suggest that there's a hint in the phrase of verse 7, &quot;from the east country, and from the west country.&quot; That phrase could simply indicate how comprehensive the regathering is rather than actual direction. I'm inclined to support the notion that these verses reference the regathering which happened beginning in 535 B.C. as opposed to a future regathering.</p>
		<p><b>Now notice verses 11-12 regarding the establishment of a time frame here:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>11 But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,&rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. <br>
			  12 	&ldquo;For the seed shall be prosperous,<br>
The vine shall give its fruit,<br>
The ground shall give her increase,<br>
And the heavens shall give their dew&mdash;<br>
I will cause the remnant of this people<br>
To possess all these. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>That certainly sounds immediate, doesn't it? <b>However, the prophecy definitely goes future in verse 20 with the phrase, &quot;Peoples shall yet come...&quot; </b>Obviously the provisions of verses 20-23 are reserved for the yet-future millennium. They project a future blessing where all the world will worship the God of the Jews that can only point to the Messianic kingdom we now know will be the one-thousand-year reign known to us as the millennium. <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=31#Millennium" title="Revelation 20 Summary" target="_blank">(See notes on Revelation 20 for details.)</a></p>

    <p>Haven't we had enough ransacking of cities? Nope! Not yet! Here's a prophecy concerning some of Jerusalem's neighbors. It is prophesied that hard combat times are still ahead for them. And those hard times would be at the hand of the armies of Alexander the Great. But here's the good news. God's prophet here does not prophesy another bout for Jerusalem. And sure enough, the armies of Alexander the Great passed by Jerusalem several times, leaving Jerusalem untouched. And the other nations mentioned here? Ransacked!<b> Tyre itself fell to Alexander in 332 B.C.</b></p>
	<p><b>Currently there is some discussion of a &quot;Damascus prophecy&quot; derived from these verses.</b> It is said that Damascus (Syria) must experience a complete destruction prior to the second coming of Jesus Christ. While we do see a reference to Damascus here, Tyre and Sidon are the big prizes in this prophecy - popular port towns through which many goods were passed. Damascus, 50 miles inland, seems to be mentioned as part of the prize. In fact, Alexander the Great went through this region and captured these cities. Regarding Damascus, there's also the inclusion of <a title="Isaiah 17 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=9&dy=20#Damascus" target="_blank">Isaiah 17:1 (see notes)</a> into this discussion.  Isaiah had prophesied that Damascus would be ruined, an event which took place in 732 B.C. at the hands of the Assyrians.</p>

	<p><b>The struggles mentioned here actually naming Greece (verse 13) came to fruition on the 25th of Kislev, 165 B.C.</b> At this time the Jews successfully defended Jerusalem from the continuing Greek (Seleucid) assaults that had begun under Antiochus Epiphanes IV in 168 B.C. He had installed a Greek idol on the altar of the Temple in 167 B.C. After defeating these Greeks, the Jews then rededicated the temple and initiated a new feast (festival) day that we know today as Chanukkah. This festival day on the Jewish calendar falls very near Christmas each year. <b>While many Bible teachers feel that verses 14-17 belong to a yet-future period of time leading up to the millennium, it seems like a stronger argument that these verses could rather be follow-up verses to the defense of Jerusalem against the Greeks indicated in verse 13.</b></p>

	<p>This chapter gets a little confusing.<b> The false shepherds here may have a prophetical reference to the Maccabean period when the Jews in Jerusalem would struggle against Antiochus Epiphanes IV in the middle of the second century. However, probably these verses refer to the Pharisees and Sadducees of Jesus' day; maybe this is the source of the imagery in </b><a title="John 10 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=3#Pharisees" target="_blank"><b>John 10</b> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> It is true that, as a result of false shepherds, Israel rejected Jesus as the Messiah. The references to Joseph and Judah make the distinction between what had been the Northern and Southern Kingdoms. The references to Assyria and Egypt describe the territory to the north and south of Israel where their historical struggles had been fought. The outcome of this chapter is victory once and for all over their enemies at the time of the millennium. <b>This causes me to lean more towards a meaning that prophesies the struggle of the Pharisees and Sadducees against Christ, especially in light of how that position fits nicely with chapters 11 </b><a href="#Reference">(see below)</a><b> and 12 </b>(<a href="#Future">see below</a>).</p>

5 whose owners slaughter them and feel no guilt; those who sell them say, &ldquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich&rsquo;; and their shepherds do not pity them. <br>
6 For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land,&rdquo; says the LORD. &ldquo;But indeed I will give everyone into his neighbor&rsquo;s hand and into the hand of his king. They shall attack the land, and I will not deliver them from their hand.&rdquo; <br>
7 &para; So I fed the flock for slaughter, in particular the poor of the flock. I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bonds; and I fed the flock. <br>
8 I dismissed the three shepherds in one month. My soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me. <br>
9 Then I said, &ldquo;I will not feed you. Let what is dying die, and what is perishing perish. Let those that are left eat each other&rsquo;s flesh.&rdquo; <br>
10 And I took my staff, Beauty, and cut it in two, that I might break the covenant which I had made with all the peoples. <br>
11 So it was broken on that day. Thus the poor of the flock, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the LORD. <br>
12 Then I said to them, &ldquo;If it is agreeable to you, give me my wages; and if not, refrain.&rdquo; So they weighed out for my wages thirty pieces of silver. <br>
13 &para; And the LORD said to me, &ldquo;Throw it to the potter&rdquo;&mdash;that princely price they set on me. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD for the potter. <br>
14 Then I cut in two my other staff, Bonds, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. <br>
15 &para; And the LORD said to me, &ldquo;Next, take for yourself the implements of a foolish shepherd. <br>
16 For indeed I will raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for those who are cut off, nor seek the young, nor heal those that are broken, nor feed those that still stand. But he will eat the flesh of the fat and tear their hooves in pieces. <br>
17 	&ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd,<br>

<p>This prophecy is a little difficult to place with certainty, but taken with chapters 12 (<a href="#Future">see below</a>) and 13 (<a href="#False">see below</a>), we seem to get a clearer picture. After careful study of the passage and external reference materials, <b>I am relatively confident that Zechariah is referring to the ministry of Christ in the midst of the hypocritical and false leadership of that day.</b> They rejected the Messiah, and the temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. <b>Verse 13 seems too much like Judas and his 30 pieces of silver not to be so, and Matthew does report that it was a fulfillment of prophecy; this is the only recorded passage from the prophets referencing 30 pieces of silver </b>(<a title="Matthew 26 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=25#Judas" target="_blank">Matthew 26:14-16</a><a title="Matthew 26 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=25" target="_blank">, see notes</a>; <a title="Matthew 27 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=6&dy=14#Judas" target="_blank">Matthew 27:3-10</a><a title="Matthew 27 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=6&dy=14" target="_blank">, see notes</a>)<b>.</b> So, it would appear that this prophecy is a picture of the times when Christ would walk the earth during his ministry here and the subsequent rejection of his Messiahship by false leadership of Israel at the time. That understanding of this chapter seems to fit nicely with chapter 12 (<a href="#Future">see below</a>), and continues an idea that began to emerge in chapter 10 (<a href="#Good">see above</a>).</p>

  <p><font size="2">1 The burden of the word of the LORD against Israel. Thus says the LORD, who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him: <br>
    2 &ldquo;Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples, when they lay siege against Judah and Jerusalem. <br>
    3 And it shall happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a very heavy stone for all peoples; all who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces, though all nations of the earth are gathered against it. <br>
    4 In that day,&rdquo; says the LORD, &ldquo;I will strike every horse with confusion, and its rider with madness; I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. <br>
    5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, &ldquo;The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in the LORD of hosts, their God.&rsquo; <br>
    6 In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a firepan in the woodpile, and like a fiery torch in the sheaves; they shall devour all the surrounding peoples on the right hand and on the left, but Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place&mdash;Jerusalem. <br>
    7 &para; &ldquo;The LORD will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall not become greater than that of Judah. <br>
    8 In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the one who is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the Angel of the LORD before them. <br>
    9 It shall be in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. <br>
    10 &para; &ldquo;And I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn. <br>
    11 In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. <br>
    12 And the land shall mourn, every family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; <br>
    13 the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself, and their wives by themselves; <br>
  14 all the families that remain, every family by itself, and their wives by themselves. </font></p>

<p>Since this chapter is an obvious reference to the gathering of the armies of the nations against Israel at the Battle of Armageddon, it is likewise obvious that chapters 10 (<a href="#Good">see above</a>) and 11<b> </b><a href="#Reference">(see below)</a> must be setting up the scenario including the rejection of Christ during his earthly ministry. <b>Chapter 12 directs us to Christ's return in </b><a title="Revelation 19 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=27#Armageddon" target="_blank"><b>Revelation 19:11-21</b> (see notes)</a><b> when Israel will be once and for all delivered.</b> Notice verse 8, &quot;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the one who is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, <b>like the Angel of the LORD before them.</b>&quot; And if you're looking for a location where this takes place, you'll find it in verse 11, &quot;the plain of Megiddo.&quot; That's right - Armageddon!</p>
<p>Let's notice verse 10, &quot;And I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn.&quot; John quotes this verse regarding the piercing of Jesus' side in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=6&dy=22#Legs" title="John 19 Summary" target="_blank">John 19:37 (see notes)</a>. </p>

    3 It shall come to pass that if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who begot him will say to him, &ldquo;You shall not live, because you have spoken lies in the name of the LORD.&rsquo; And his father and mother who begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesies. <br>
    4 &para; &ldquo;And it shall be in that day that every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; they will not wear a robe of coarse hair to deceive. <br>

<p>We know from <a title="Matthew 24 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=17#Question" target="_blank">Matthew 24:11 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.&quot; These are the tribulation prophets during the first half of the seven-year period. These verses in Zechariah 13:1-6 seem to address these characters.</p>

<p>In chapter 10, we saw references to shepherds which seemed to match up nicely with Christ's words in <a title="John 10 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=3#Pharisees" target="_blank">John 10 (see notes)</a>. The &quot;sword against My shepherd&quot; seems to be a description of the rejection of Christ, the Messiah, prior to the cross. The one-third remnant looks to those Jews who will be saved during the tribulation.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Jesus quotes verse 7 as he addresses the Apostles on the eve of the crucifixion in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=29#Denial" title="Matthew 26; Mark 14" target="_blank">Matthew 26:31 and Mark 14:27 (see notes)</a>.</p>

  <p><font size="2">1 Behold, the day of the LORD is coming,<br>
And your spoil will be divided in your midst. <br>
2 	For I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem;<br>
The city shall be taken,<br>
The houses rifled,<br>
And the women ravished.<br>
Half of the city shall go into captivity,<br>
But the remnant of the people shall not be cut off from the city. <br>
3 	Then the LORD will go forth<br>
And fight against those nations,<br>
As He fights in the day of battle. <br>
4 	And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives,<br>
Which faces Jerusalem on the east.<br>
And the Mount of Olives shall be split in two,<br>
From east to west,<br>
Making a very large valley;<br>
Half of the mountain shall move toward the north<br>
And half of it toward the south. <br>
5 	Then you shall flee through My mountain valley,<br>
For the mountain valley shall reach to Azal.<br>
Yes, you shall flee<br>
As you fled from the earthquake<br>

Thus the LORD my God will come,<br>
And all the saints with You. <br>

But at evening time it shall happen<br>
That it will be light. <br>

That living waters shall flow from Jerusalem,<br>

And half of them toward the western sea;<br>
In both summer and winter it shall occur. <br>
9 	And the LORD shall be King over all the earth.<br>
In that day it shall be&mdash;<br>
&ldquo;The LORD is one,&rdquo;<br>

10 &para; All the land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. Jerusalem shall be raised up and inhabited in her place from Benjamin&rsquo;s Gate to the place of the First Gate and the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king&rsquo;s winepresses. <br>
11 	The people shall dwell in it;<br>
And no longer shall there be utter destruction,<br>
But Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited. <br>
12 &para; And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the people who fought against Jerusalem:<br>
Their flesh shall dissolve while they stand on their feet,<br>
Their eyes shall dissolve in their sockets,<br>
And their tongues shall dissolve in their mouths. <br>
13 	It shall come to pass in that day<br>
That a great panic from the LORD will be among them.<br>
Everyone will seize the hand of his neighbor,<br>
And raise his hand against his neighbor&rsquo;s hand; <br>
14 	Judah also will fight at Jerusalem.<br>
And the wealth of all the surrounding nations<br>
Shall be gathered together:<br>
Gold, silver, and apparel in great abundance. <br>
15 	Such also shall be the plague<br>

19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. <br>
20 &para; In that day &ldquo;HOLINESS TO THE Lord&rdquo; shall be engraved on the bells of the horses. The pots in the LORD&rsquo;S house shall be like the bowls before the altar. <br>

<p>In this chapter we see the Lord's second coming, his fighting at the Battle of Armageddon (<a title="Revelation 19 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=27#Armageddon" target="_blank">Revelation 19:11-21, see notes</a>) and his reigning during the millennium to follow. There's an abundance of detailed specifications found in this prophecy regarding this time period. The &quot;eastern sea&quot; of verse 8 is a reference to the Dead Sea. <a title="Ezekiel 47 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=6#River" target="_blank">Ezekiel 47:1-12 (see notes)</a> also describes a river that flows from the temple into the Dead Sea. Well...you just can't get around verse 9, &quot;And the LORD shall be King over all the earth. 	In that day it shall be&mdash; 	'The LORD is one,' 	And His name one.&quot; <b>It's definitely Messianic (millennial) in its context.</b> And verse 11 adds, &quot;<b>Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.</b>&quot; Not only so, but &quot;<b>the LORD will strike all the people who fought against Jerusalem</b>&quot; (verse 12). And where is the center of activity during the millennium? Why...Jerusalem of course, as we see in verses 16-17, &quot;And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. And it shall be that whichever of the families of the earth do not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, on them there will be no rain.&quot; <b>No worship - no rain; it's just that simple!</b></p>
<p>One more geographical note is in order here. You will notice in verse 4 that <strong>the site of the second coming is given</strong>, &quot;And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, 	Which faces Jerusalem on the east. 	And the Mount of Olives shall be split in two, 	From east to west, 	Making a very large valley; 	Half of the mountain shall move toward the north 	And half of it toward the south.&quot; When Jesus ascended to Heaven in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=7&dy=4#Resurrection" title="Acts 1 Summary" target="_blank">Acts 1:9-11 (see notes)</a>, it was from the Mount of Olives. At that time, the disciples were told that <strong>the Mount of Olives was to be his arrival point at the second coming.</strong></p>
