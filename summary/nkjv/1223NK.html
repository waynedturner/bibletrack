<p><b>An Overview<br>
  These two beasts of Revelation 13 are men;</b> on that much virtually
  everyone agrees. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The first 10 verses of this chapter describe the beast many commonly refer to as the &quot;antichrist.&quot;</span> Notice that the
  description of this beast is similar to that of <a title="Daniel 7 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=12#Daniel" target="_blank">Daniel 7:7-8 (see notes)</a> with regard to the head/horn
  configuration. What we know for sure about this man from this chapter
  is that he will be an incarnation of Satan himself (<a title="II Thessalonians 2 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=24#Tribulation" target="_blank">II Thessalonians 2, see notes</a><b>)</b> and rule during the 42
  months that mark the last half of the tribulation. Daniel calls this
  anti-God act of <a title="II Thessalonians 2 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=24#Tribulation" target="_blank">II Thessalonians 2 (see notes)</a> the abomination of desolation
  in <a title="Daniel 9 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=12#Antichrist" target="_blank">Daniel 9:27 (see notes)</a>, to which Jesus makes direct reference
  in <a title="Matthew 24 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=5&dy=17#Antichrist" target="_blank">Matthew 24:15, Mark 13:14 (see notes)</a>. He'll make war against
  those who serve God during this period of time. One of the most
  well-respected men in the study of prophecy is J. Dwight Pentecost. See
  the article entitled "Who is the Beast" located to the right of the
screen in the information box, <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Pentecost.html" title="Who is the Beast" target="_blank">or you may click here to read it in a separate window.</a></p>
<p><strong>The details</strong><br>
Many view &ldquo;the sea&rdquo; in verse 1 as symbolic of Gentile origin. The &ldquo;seven heads and ten horns&rdquo; is viewed by most as a federation of ten nations headed by the &ldquo;beast&rdquo; where the &ldquo;heads&rdquo; are leaders and the &ldquo;horns&rdquo; are nations. The &ldquo;blasphemy&rdquo; indicates his animosity for God.</p>
<p><strong>In verse 2, the description of the beast mirrors 3 of 4 beasts in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=12#Daniel" title="Daniel 7 Summary" target="_blank">Daniel 7 </a></strong><a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=12#Daniel" title="Daniel 7 Summary" target="_blank">(see notes)</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leopard = Greek Empire</li>
  <li>Bear = Medo-Persian Empire</li>
  <li>Lion = Babylonian Empire</li>
</ul>
<p>This merging into one beast must have some relevance here, although it is not certain what. The &ldquo;dragon&rdquo; aka Satan empowers him.</p>
<p>In verse 3, one of the seven heads is seen as having had a mortal wound which was healed. If the &ldquo;heads&rdquo; in verse 1 are leaders, then one of the nations in the federation was resurrected after apparent destruction OR one of the leaders was perceived to have been resurrected. We clearly see a worship of Satan by the world in verse 4 as he (&quot;the dragon&quot;) empowers the beast. Paul refers to this phenomenon in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=10&dy=24#Tribulation" title="II Thessalonians 2 Summary" target="_blank">II Thessalonians 2:3-4 (see notes)</a> when he says, &quot;Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.&quot; The beast will be regarded as invincible.</p>
<p>Notice the extent of the beast's blasphemy in verses 5-6. He will blaspheme what we know about God to be true. These 42 months here encompass the last half of the tribulation.<br>
Notice the extent of his blasphemy in verse 6. He will blaspheme against God, God's name, God's tabernacle and all them that dwell in Heaven. No question, he's a bad man who is motivated by Satan himself. In verse 7, we see that the beast will make war against the people who have been saved during the tribulation. His influence will be worldwide, yet not without resistance, as seen in Revelation 16 (<a href="#Tribulation">see below</a>).</p>
<p>We are told in verse 8 that all of those who are unregenerate (&quot;whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb&quot;) will worship this beast. However, we are assured in verses 9-10 that the wicked, including the beast, will come to their just end.<br>
</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Second"></a>The second of two beasts (Revelation 13:11-18)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style2">11 &para; Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. <br>
12 And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. <br>
13 He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. <br>
14 And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. <br>
15 He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. <br>
16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, <br>
17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. <br>
18 &para; Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We find in verses 11-18 the <span class="style1">assistant</span> beast we commonly call the &quot;false
  prophet.&quot; As a matter of fact, he is referred to as such in Revelation 16:13 (<a href="#Tribulation">see below</a>) and <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=27#Armageddon" title="Revelation 19 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 19:20 (see notes)</a>. If the &ldquo;sea&rdquo; in verse 1 (<a href="#Beasts">see above</a>) means the first beast (aka antichrist) is a Gentile, then perhaps the &ldquo;earth&rdquo; of verse 11 means the false prophet here is &ldquo;Jewish.&rdquo;<b> He's the religious leader and public relations guy who makes the people worship the first beast</b> (aka antichrist)<b>.</b> He is described as a lamb who speaks as a dragon. Satan is described as the &quot;dragon&quot; in verses 1-10 (<a href="#Beasts">see above</a>). He's powerful like the first beast and is successful in deceiving the unbelieving world because he exercises some supernatural powers (from Satan) in support of the first beast; he also has an image of the first beast erected for worship purposes and makes it appear alive. He is to the first beast (aka antichrist) what John the Baptist was to Christ, and even brings fire down from Heaven as Elijah did (verse 13). That's particularly significant in view of the fact that Jews were and are still looking for a forerunner to the Messiah according to their understanding of <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=30#John" title="Malachi 3 Summary" target="_blank">Malachi 3:1 (see notes)</a> and <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=30#Elijah" title="Malachi 4 Summary" target="_blank">Malachi 4:5-6 (see notes)</a>. <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/John-Elijah.html" title="Was John the Baptist Elijah" target="_blank">To fully understand this discussion, read the article entitled, &quot;Was John the Baptist Elijah?&quot; by clicking here.</a> In fact, I'm convinced that one of the two witnesses in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=19#Witnesses" title="Revelation 11 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 11 (see notes)</a> comes in that spirit of Elijah as the forerunner to the second coming of Jesus Christ In <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=27#Armageddon" title="Revelation 19 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 19:11-21 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p>So, let's get the big picture on this false prophet from verses 14-18. He deceives the world through supernatural powers and institutes worship of the &ldquo;beast&rdquo; and his image. He is even able to give life-like qualities to the image. Those who refuse to worship the first beast (aka antichrist) will be killed. Hmmm...he does sound like a diabolical Elijah, doesn't he? This false prophet controls commerce by marking people who will worship the first beast on their hand or forehead. Without the mark, tribulation inhabitants won't be able to do business. Here's that infamous &quot;666&quot; we hear so much about.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the state of electronic commerce in the world today facilitates the commerce scenario summarized in verses 16-18. In 2009, we are very near being a cashless society with regard to business transactions already. With the insistence of government that all receive a unique identifying number in their first year of life, it is not difficult to imagine that everyone may be buying and selling based upon that identifying number in the near future. Moreover, who doesn't believe that it is just a matter of time before scanning that number somewhere on or under our skin is not the way purchases will be made within a few years. At that point, commerce will be very easy to control, as is the scenario in verses 16-18.</p>
<p><a name="Facts"></a><font size="4"><b>Some facts about the 144,000 witnesses (Revelation
14:1-5)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style2">1 Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father&rsquo;s name written on their foreheads. <br>
    2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps. <br>
    3 They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. <br>
    4 These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed from among men, being firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. <br>
    5 And in their mouth was found no deceit, for they are without fault before the throne of God. <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No question - Jesus is the &quot;Lamb&quot; on the literal Mount Sion (Zion) in verse 1. A new song of redemption is heard, and only the 144,000 could &ldquo;learn&rdquo; the song. Remember the 144,000 witnesses (chapter 7) who got saved after the
  rapture of the church to preach to the world during the tribulation? <a title="Revelation 7 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=15#144,000" target="_blank">(Click here to review the notes on Revelation 7 regarding the 144,000.)</a> Well, here we find out more about these people. They
  are unmarried men (verse 4); they were only the first ones to be saved
  during the tribulation, not all the saved (verse 4), and they live
blameless lives (verse 5).</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Angels"></a>Three angels with messages
(Revelation 14:6-13)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style2">6 &para; Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth&mdash;to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people&mdash; <br>
7 saying with a loud voice, &ldquo;Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.&rdquo; <br>
8 &para; And another angel followed, saying, &ldquo;Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.&rdquo; <br>
9 &para; Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, &ldquo;If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, <br>
10 he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. <br>
11 And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.&rdquo; <br>
12 &para; Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. <br>
13 &para; Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, &ldquo;Write: &lsquo;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; &para; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says the Spirit, &ldquo;that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them.&rdquo; <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>first angel</b> comes with an appeal to the earth to turn to
  God (verses 6-7). The <b>second angel </b>appears in verse 8 to project the fall of the wicked seat of the first beast (aka antichrist), Babylon, which isn't introduced again until Revelation 16:19 (<a href="#Tribulation">see below</a>). We'll see this in greater detail in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=27#Players" title="Revelation 17 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 17-18 (see notes)</a>. Babylon's &quot;fornication&quot; refers to her spiritual wickedness. The <b>third angel </b>proclaims
  the consequences of aligning with the antichrist during the
  tribulation. <b>Those people who accept the mark of the beast are in
    for a tough ride!</b> Just look particularly at verses 9-12 to see what's in store for them. &quot;Better dead than red!&quot; is the message here. Okay, okay! I made that up, but on good authority. Remember <a title="Revelation 12 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=19#History" target="_blank">Revelation 12:3 (see notes)</a>? What color is the dragon who is incarnate in the this first beast (aka antichrist)? So I'll say it again, <b>"Better dead than red!"</b></p>
<p>A wine metaphor is used in verse 10 which actually extends throughout the remainder of this chapter. The harvest of wine here is a harvest of the lost. The lost go to a fiery judgment. These are the ones who will adopt the mark of the beast (verse 9 and 11). The contrast is seen in verses 12-13 as we see those who &quot;die in the Lord&quot; during this period.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>The great harvest (Revelation 14:14-20)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style2">14 &para; Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. <br>
15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, &ldquo;Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.&rdquo; <br>
16 So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. <br>
17 &para; Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. <br>
18 &para; And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, &ldquo;Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.&rdquo; <br>
19 So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. <br>
20 And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses&rsquo; bridles, for one thousand six hundred furlongs. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Verse 14 introduces the second coming of Jesus Christ. Let's have a glimpse of the end with the assistance of three more
  angels (verses 15, 17, 18).</b> We'll see the Battle of Armageddon in some detail in <a title="Revelation 19 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=27#Armageddon" target="_blank">Revelation 19:11-21 (see notes)</a>, but here's a preview. The &quot;Son of Man, having on his head a golden crown&quot; is Jesus at the second coming (end of the tribulation). The &quot;sharp sickle&quot; is undoubtedly an instrument of judgment. The phrase &quot;her grapes are fully ripe&quot; is probably referring to the wickedness of the beast's (aka antichrist's) people in keeping with the wine metaphor of verses 9-12. The description of the &quot;blood&quot; in verse 20 surely refers to the judgment of Christ on the wicked at the end of the tribulation. Whoa - better be on God's side! Let me emphasize again, I'm convinced that today's Believers will be long gone from the earth when all of this takes place. <b>My position, the
    pre-tribulation-rapture position, dictates that the rapture takes place
    prior to this seven-year period.</b></p>
<p><a name="Plagues"></a><font size="4"><b>Seven angels and seven plagues (Revelation 15)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style2">1 Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God is complete. <br>
    2 &para; And I saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who have the victory over the beast, over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God. <br>
    3 They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying:<br>
&ldquo;Great and marvelous are Your works,<br>
Lord God Almighty!<br>
Just and true are Your ways,<br>
O King of the saints! <br>
4 	Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name?<br>
For You alone are holy.<br>
For all nations shall come and worship before You,<br>
For Your judgments have been manifested.&rdquo; <br>
5 &para; After these things I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened. <br>
6 And out of the temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues, clothed in pure bright linen, and having their chests girded with golden bands. <br>
7 Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever. <br>
8 The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one was able to enter the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This short chapter introduces the last few days of the tribulation. <b>The seven angels are given the vial judgments. As stated in the summary on <a title="Revelation 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=19#Trumpet" target="_blank">Revelation 11:15-19</a></b><a title="Revelation 11 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=19#Trumpet" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a><b>, it would appear that the
  seventh trumpet judgment shown there contains the seven vial judgments
  that are introduced here. </b>You'll see from the description of these
  judgments in following chapters that <b>the world is very close to the end of the tribulation at this point; the earth simply cannot survive the consequences of these judgments for an extended period of time.</b> That's why we see in verse 1 that after these, the &quot;wrath of God&quot; is &quot;filled up.&quot; These seven vial judgments finish out the judgments of the tribulation.</p>
<p>In verse 2, we see a &quot;sea of glass mingled with fire.&quot; We first saw this sea of glass in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=15#Heaven" title="Revelation 4 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 4:6 (see notes)</a>. We are told that this event takes place in Heaven. Just a few days remain in the tribulation. These &quot;who have the victory over the beast&quot; have been martyred, thus, the &quot;sea of glass mingled with fire.&quot;</p>
<p>In verses 3-4 these martyred saints sing a couple of songs - &quot;the song of the Lamb&quot; and &quot;the song of Moses.&quot; Moses actually wrote two songs - one in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=15#Song" title="Exodus 15 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 15 (see notes)</a> regarding victory over Egyptians  and his farewell song in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=4&dy=18#Song" title="Deuteronomy 32 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 32 (see notes)</a>. This &ldquo;song of Moses&rdquo; is probably the one in Exodus 15.</p>
<p>In verse 5, it is worth noting here that the tabernacle and temple on earth were representations of that which is in Heaven. <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=11&dy=13#Perfection" title="Hebrews 9 Summary" target="_blank">Hebrews 9:24 (see notes)</a> says, &quot;For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.&quot;  Likewise, the &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; priesthood is that of Melchisedec; Aaron's priesthood was earthly and temporary. In verse 6-8, these angels are the ones who deliver the last 7 judgments of the tribulation, the vial judgments. As you can see, these judgments come straight out of the temple in Heaven. Notice the &quot;smoke&quot; in verse 8. This smoke represents the Shekinah Glory first seen in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=15#Sight" title="Exodus 13 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 13:21-22 (see notes)</a>. God's glory, in the form of smoke, filled the tabernacle in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=27#Presence" title="Exodus 40 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 40:34-38 (see notes)</a>. It again filled Solomon's temple in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=8&dy=7#Ark" title="I Kings 8; II Chronicles 5 Summary" target="_blank">I Kings 8/II Chronicles 5 (see notes)</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="style2">1 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, &ldquo;Go and pour out the bowls of the wrath of God on the earth.&rdquo; <br>
    2 &para; So the first went and poured out his bowl upon the earth, and a foul and loathsome sore came upon the men who had the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. <br>
    3 &para; Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living creature in the sea died. <br>
    4 &para; Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. <br>
    5 And I heard the angel of the waters saying:<br>
&ldquo;You are righteous, O Lord,<br>
The One who is and who was and who is to be,<br>
Because You have judged these things. <br>
6 	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets,<br>
And You have given them blood to drink.<br>
For it is their just due.&rdquo; <br>
7 &para; And I heard another from the altar saying, &ldquo;Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.&rdquo; <br>
8 &para; Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and power was given to him to scorch men with fire. <br>
9 And men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues; and they did not repent and give Him glory. <br>
10 &para; Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues because of the pain. <br>
11 They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their deeds. <br>
12 &para; Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared. <br>
13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. <br>
14 For they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. <br>
15 &para; &ldquo;Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.&rdquo;<br>
16 &para; And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon. <br>
17 &para; Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, &ldquo;It is done!&rdquo; <br>
18 And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth. <br>
19 Now the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And great Babylon was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath. <br>
20 Then every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. <br>
21 And great hail from heaven fell upon men, each hailstone about the weight of a talent. Men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, since that plague was exceedingly great. </p>

<p>Tough - really, really tough! </p>
<p><b>This chapter contains the last judgments of the tribulation, the seven vial judgments from the seven
angels. Here they are:<br>
</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Sores on the mark-of-the-beast people (verse 2) <br>
  Two Greek words are used to indicate intensity of the pain from these sores. The first, &quot;noisome&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;kakos.&quot; It's the generally used Greek word for &quot;bad.&quot; The word &quot;grievous&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;poneros&quot; and means &quot;evil.&quot; All indications are that this is a global occurrence. Remember Egypt's plague #6? That plague consisted of oozing boils?  (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=12#Boils" title="Exodus 9 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 9:8-12, see notes</a>)</li>
  <li>The sea is poisoned and everything in it dies. (verse 3)<br>
  The &ldquo;seas&rdquo; are turned to blood. This is also a global occurrence. All life in the sea dies. The word &ldquo;soul&rdquo; is translated from Greek word &quot;psuche,&quot; here indicating all creatures that live in the sea.</li>
  <li>The springs and waters are turned to blood (verses 4-7) <br>
  The natural fresh water sources are turned to blood. This also appears to be a global occurrence. How long can the earth survive without fresh water? This happened also in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=12#River" title="Exodus 7 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 7:14-25 (see notes)</a> - the first plague upon Egypt just prior to the exodus.</li>
  <li>The sun becomes vicious (verses 8-9) <br>
  The intensity of the heat of the sun upon the earth is altered. The word &ldquo;scorch&rdquo; (Greek: kaumatizo) means to cause suffering through intense heat. Somehow, the righteous are not affected by this phenomenon.</li>
  <li>The kingdom of the antichrist is turned into darkness (verses
10-11) <br>
  Darkness covers the &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; of the &ldquo;beast.&rdquo; This is not a global occurrence. The effects of the previous vial judgments are still nagging at them. They &ldquo;blaspheme&rdquo; and do not repent of their deeds. Plague #9 in Egypt included 3 days of darkness (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=2&dy=13#Darkness" title="Exodus 10 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 10:21-29, see notes</a>)</li>
  <li>The Euphrates is dried up and everybody gets ready for the Battle
of Armageddon. (verses 12-16) <br>
  This is to facilitate the gathering of armies at Armageddon assumed by most to be in the plains of Esdraelon where many notable battles have been fought. The &quot;three unclean spirits&quot; of verse 13 come out of the dragon (Satan - <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=19#History" title="Revelation 12 Summary">Revelation 12, see notes</a>), beast #1 (aka antichrist - Revelation 13:1-10, <a href="#Beasts">see above</a>) and beast #2 aka false prophet (Revelation 13:11-18, <a href="#Second">see above</a>). These summon world leaders to gather their armies for Armageddon. Incidentally, this is the only usage in the New Testament of the word &quot;Armageddon.&quot;</li>
  <li>Storm, earthquake and the pagan city (<a href="#Angels">Babylon - see above, 14:8</a>) is destroyed, and
ALL HAIL
BREAKS LOOSE! (verses 17-21) <br>
  This is the last judgment. There will be earthquakes which will cause major land shifting. The &quot;hail out of heaven&quot; is awesome, inasmuch as each hail stone will weigh approximately 90 pounds. This plague will include the collapse of world governments and the Battle of Armageddon.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will notice in verses 17-21 that a major transformation of the earth takes place. Ezekiel's temple (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=2#Temple" title="Ezekiel 40-48 Summary" target="_blank">Ezekiel 40-48, see notes</a>) won't actually fit on the real estate as it now sits in Jerusalem. This supernatural earth-moving plague is necessary to make room for the millennial temple.</p>
<p><b>This chapter takes us to the end of the tribulation, but </b><a title="Revelation 17-19 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&mo=12&dy=27#Top" target="_blank"><b>Revelation 17-19</b> (see notes)</a><b> will give us more detail regarding these events.</b></p>
