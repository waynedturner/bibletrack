<p>Here is an important truth about Jesus' ministry. <b>Why did he speak to the people in parables?</b> Some have suggested that Jesus' parables were given as crystal-clear illustrations to make a point. Well...not really! There is a concept here that needs to be understood first of all. We explained in the introduction of <a title="Matthew 5 Introduction" href="9-12.html#Isaiah" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a>, &quot;And He said, 'Go, and tell this people: 	&quot;Keep on hearing, but do not understand; 	Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.&quot;  Make the heart of this people dull, 	And their ears heavy, 	And shut their eyes; 	Lest they see with their eyes, 	And hear with their ears, 	And understand with their heart, 	And return and be healed.'&quot;  Isaiah prophesied the rejection of the Messiah's message that would take place. Roll the clock forward 700 or so years from Isaiah, and here we are;<b> it's just as Isaiah prophesied.</b> Jesus is presenting the Kingdom message for them to receive, but the jealous Jewish leaders reject it - just like the Jewish leaders to whom Isaiah had prophesied. It was prophesied that they would do so. However, <b>those people with receptive hearts do understand the meaning of the parables; the Jewish leaders are not blessed by his words.</b> Furthermore, when Jesus spoke in parables these Jewish leaders were not able to gather clear statements that would meet their legal standard of blasphemy. Parables were very frustrating to these officials and professional religionists.<b> To state it clearly, parables were designed to keep the hypocritical Jewish leaders frustrated while spiritually feeding those who had receptive hearts.</b></p>

<p>Here's the meaning of that first parable in <font size="3">Matthew 13:3-9; Mark 4:3-9; Luke 8:4-8 (<a href="2-2.html#Top" target="_blank"><b>Matthew 5</b> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> If it's unclear, read the preceding section of this summary again. Secondly, pay very close attention to the wording of Matthew 13:19, &quot;When any one <b>hears the word of the kingdom</b>...&quot; <b>You misrepresent this whole parable if you make the sown seed equivalent to a salvation experience.</b> <b>IT IS NOT!</b> It literally speaks of those who were exposed to Jesus' teaching on the coming Kingdom of God/Heaven on earth which had been prophesied by the Old Testament prophets. That understanding should make the rest of the parable fall into place. Only the last category of people (Matthew 13:23, Mark 4:20, Luke 8:15) actually receive this word of the Kingdom and respond to it. Remember, it's a kingdom message to the Jews. <b>Again, let me say, this parable has NO DIRECT RELEVANCE to the salvation experience of today.</b> While parallels certainly exist, keep in mind the strict application of this passage to the reception (or not) of the Kingdom message.</p>
<p><b>Let's take a look at the implications regarding the four kinds of ground upon which the seeds fell:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Some fell by the wayside and were immediately eaten by birds.<br>
				</b>They heard the message, perhaps found it interesting, but only had a passing interest and took no action by personalizing the message of the Kingdom.
			<li><b>Some fell on stony places and could not take root.<br>
				</b>These people heard the message and were interested, but they did not pursue the Kingdom message.
			<li><b>Some fell among thorns and was choked out.<br>
				</b>These people heard the message, were interested and began to pursue the Kingdom message. However, they allowed themselves to be influenced by those Jewish leaders who rejected the Messianic ministry of Jesus. This ultimately led to their rejection of the message as well.
			<li><b>The rest fell on good ground, grew and multiplied.<br>
				</b>These people heard, pursued, received and multiplied. These are the only ones of the four groups who followed through with discipleship after hearing the Messianic message.
        </ul>
		<p>Here's the BIG PROBLEM with equating this parable to salvation by grace as many under-studied people do. They often jump to the false conclusion that the sowing of this seed is the same as receiving Christ as Savior. After they make that interpretive error, they then assume that the first three scenarios represent a loss of salvation. THIS PARABLE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A BELIEVER'S SALVATION BY GRACE! Read the parable and notes above again if that is not clear to you.</p>

		<p>Only Mark and Luke give us this parable. This message is simple. If the crowds do not obey what light they receive, they will never receive more. These verses follow nicely behind the parable of the sower. This is a polite warning from Jesus to the multitudes to beware of dismissing this teaching without accepting the truth of the Kingdom message contained herein.

<p>Only Mark recites this parable. The seed, the Kingdom message, has been cast by Jesus. The analogy here is as follows: just as seed is cast onto the ground and the earth uses it to bear fruit for the harvest, so has Jesus cast the seed of the Kingdom message. The good ground (receptive heart) bears fruit worthy of harvest (entry into the Kingdom). This speaks of the Messianic Kingdom of Jesus on earth (<a title="Matthew 5 Introduction" href="2-2.html#Top" target="_blank">Matthew 5, see notes</a>) and not Heaven.</p>

26 But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared.<br />
27 So the servants of the owner came and said to him, &ldquo;Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?&rsquo;<br />
28 He said to them, &ldquo;An enemy has done this.&rsquo; The servants said to him, &lsquo;Do you want us then to go and gather them up?&rsquo;<br />
29 But he said, &ldquo;No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them.<br />
30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, &ldquo;First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;<br />

<p> This mustard plant is only about four feet tall in the early spring when birds are nesting. Later on in the summer this plant (bush) may reach as high as 15 feet or so - plenty large for the nesting of birds. Likewise, <b>the Kingdom message will be preached in relative obscurity in the beginning </b>(small mustard seed)<b>, but will ultimately result in the world-wide ushering in of the Messiah's Kingdom of God/Heaven on earth.</b> I think this is perhaps <b>strictly a growth analogy</b> - from relative obscurity to a global kingdom - the Messianic Kingdom (<a title="Matthew 5 Introduction" href="2-2.html#Top" target="_blank">Matthew 5, see notes</a>) we know as the Millennium. </p>
<p>Some Bible teachers have read more into this parable than I feel comfortable doing with any certainty. They have suggested evil on the part of the birds that lodge in the mustard tree. Although, Jesus uses this metaphor again in <a href="4-7.html#Message" title="Luke 13 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 13:19 (see notes)</a>. On that occasion, Jesus had been addressing the insincerity and hypocrisy of the Jewish leadership. I can see how that one might understand the birds in the tree to be these hypocritical Jewish leaders, inasmuch as they are integrated into the growth environment, but not part of the growth. In other words, they are the problem and not the solution.</p>

		<p><font size="3">Some have suggested that the mention of leaven in scripture is always bad. Well, not here! This parable indicates that the message of the<b> Kingdom of God/Heaven will grow from within.</b> It will not need to be propped up and cultivated by the insincere religious leaders from without. When this Kingdom is established, it will have happened from the simple message of redemption preached by Jesus himself in the beginning. <b>Leavened dough starts small and ends up large.</b> Likewise, the Kingdom message starts small with the teaching of Jesus and one day will be the global kingdom over all the earth - the Messianic Kingdom </font>(<a title="Matthew 5 Introduction" href="2-2.html#Top" target="_blank">Matthew 5, see notes</a>)<font size="3">.</font></p>
		<p>Jesus quotes in verse 35 from <a href="6-4.html#Slack" title="Psalm 78 Summary" target="_blank">Psalm 78:2 (see notes)</a>, &quot;I will open my mouth in a parable; 	I will utter dark sayings of old.&quot; In that Psalm, Asaph uses verse 2 as part of his introduction to the history of Israel from Egypt to King David. Matthew must be looking at Jesus' words hear as a fulfillment in the sense that Asaph was considered a prophet and conveyed the mind of God just as Jesus did on this occasion, as well as other occasions.</p>
