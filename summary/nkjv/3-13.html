<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 &para; Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying: <br />
2 &ldquo;Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers&rsquo; houses, according to the number of names, every male individually, <br />
3 from twenty years old and above&mdash;all who are able to go to war in Israel. You and Aaron shall number them by their armies. <br />
4 And with you there shall be a man from every tribe, each one the head of his father&rsquo;s house. <br />
  </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><font size="3">We're 13 months out of Egypt when God requires Moses to get a count of the fighting men of Israel. This count consists of all men above 20 years of age who are not Levites.</font> The Levites were exempt from military service.</p>
<p><strong>Step #1: Determine the names of the leaders of each tribe </strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">5 &para; &ldquo;These are the names of the men who shall stand with you: from Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur; <br />
6 from Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai; <br />
7 from Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab; <br />
8 from Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar; <br />
9 from Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon; <br />
10 from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur; <br />
11 from Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni; <br />
12 from Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai; <br />
13 from Asher, Pagiel the son of Ocran; <br />
14 from Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel; <br />
15 from Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan.&rdquo; <br />
16 These were chosen from the congregation, leaders of their fathers&rsquo; tribes, heads of the divisions in Israel. <br />
  </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><strong>Step #2: Arrange all the people under their tribal respective leader</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">17 &para; Then Moses and Aaron took these men who had been mentioned by name, <br />
18 and they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month; and they recited their ancestry by families, by their fathers&rsquo; houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, each one individually. <br />
19 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the Wilderness of Sinai. <br />
  </font></p>

43 those who were numbered of the tribe of Naphtali were fifty-three thousand four hundred. <br />
  </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><strong>But what about the Levites - the sons of Levi?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">44 &para; These are the ones who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, with the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each one representing his father&rsquo;s house. <br />
45 So all who were numbered of the children of Israel, by their fathers&rsquo; houses, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war in Israel&mdash; <br />
46 all who were numbered were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty. <br />
47 &para; But the Levites were not numbered among them by their fathers&rsquo; tribe; <br />
48 for the LORD had spoken to Moses, saying: <br />
49 &ldquo;Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor take a census of them among the children of Israel; <br />
50 but you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, over all its furnishings, and over all things that belong to it; they shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they shall attend to it and camp around the tabernacle. <br />
51 And when the tabernacle is to go forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up. The outsider who comes near shall be put to death. <br />
52 The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, everyone by his own camp, everyone by his own standard, according to their armies; <br />
53 but the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel; and the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony.&rdquo; <br />
54 &para; Thus the children of Israel did; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they did. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">How appropriate that the Book of Numbers begins with...numbers. Here we're going to get a count of how many in each Tribe of Israel...with a couple of exceptions. Our count found here will <b>include only men</b> (20 years of age and older). And one more thing - <b>no Levites are counted here; </b>we'll get their count in <a title="Numbers 3-4 Summary" href="3-15.html#Levites" target="_blank">Numbers 3-4 (see notes)</a>. Why the age of 20? Verse 3 specifies, &quot;all that are able to go forth to war.&quot; The Levites were the keepers of the Tabernacle; they were special (verses 49-54).</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>So, here are your population figures for the Tribes of Israel 13 months after the Exodus:</b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font size="3">Reuben - 46,500</font>
			<li><font size="3">Simeon - 59,300</font>
			<li><font size="3">Gad - 45,650</font>
			<li><font size="3">Judah - 74,600</font>
			<li><font size="3">Issachar - 54,400</font>

			<li><font size="3">Naphtali - 53,400</font>
		</ul>
		<p>This gives us a total of 603,550 men, 20 years of age and older. This total is also given in <a title="Exodus 38 Summary" href="2-25.html#Atonement" target="_blank">Exodus 38:21 (see notes)</a>, it seems to already be understood that the Levites have this special place among the Hebrews.</p>

	<p><font size="3">This chapter deals with the arrangement of the camp in the wilderness. I have prepared a visual below to illustrate the numeric strength of the tribes along with their positioning in the camp. You'll notice that on each side of the Tabernacle Judah, Reuben, Ephraim and Dan were each flanked by two other tribes. The formation was orderly and deliberate.</font></p>
<div align="center">
			<p><img src="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/image/Tribes_wilderness.gif" alt="Tribes of Israel in the Wilderness" height="508" width="616" border="0"></p>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p>Some observations are in order. You will notice that <b>Rachel's boys are positioned together on the west side</b> of the tabernacle. <b>Leah's boys are on the east and south side</b> of the tabernacle with one exception; <b>Gad (the son of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid) slips down into the open slot with Leah's two oldest sons, Reuben and Simeon on the south side.</b> <b>The remainder of the handmaids' sons reside together on the north side of the encampment.</b> Gad wasn't the oldest of the handmaids sons, but he was the oldest of Leah's handmaid. </p>
			<p>It's interesting that hundreds of years later, an order is still observed in keeping with the birth of Jacob's sons. As a matter of fact, there's also listed a lead tribe on each side of the encampment - Judah on the east, Reuben on the south, Ephraim on the west and Dan on the north. These are the senior sons of Jacob that take the lead with one exception - Ephraim. However, you will recall that when Jacob adopted the two boys (Manasseh and Ephraim) in <a title="Genesis 48:5-22 Summary" href="2-8.html#Jacob" target="_blank">Genesis 48:5-22 (see notes)</a>, he gave the elder-son birthright to the younger son, Ephraim instead. So...there you have the logic behind the positioning of the Tribes of Israel around the tabernacle.</p>
