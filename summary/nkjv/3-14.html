4 For God commanded, saying, &ldquo;Honor your father and your mother&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.&rsquo;<br />
5 But you say, &ldquo;Whoever says to his father or mother, &lsquo;Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
6 then he need not honor his father or mother.&rsquo; Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.<br />
7 Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:<br />
8 	&ldquo;These people draw near to Me with their mouth,<br />
And honor Me with their lips,<br />
But their heart is far from Me.<br />
9 	And in vain they worship Me,<br />

11 Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.&rdquo;<br />
12 &para; Then His disciples came and said to Him, &ldquo;Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?&rdquo; <br />
13 &para; But He answered and said, &ldquo;Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.<br />
14 Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch.&rdquo;<br />
15 &para; Then Peter answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Explain this parable to us.&rdquo; <br />
16 &para; So Jesus said, &ldquo;Are you also still without understanding?<br />
17 Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?<br />
18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.<br />
19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.<br />
20 These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.&rdquo;<br />

3 For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands in a special way, holding the tradition of the elders. <br />
4 When they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other things which they have received and hold, like the washing of cups, pitchers, copper vessels, and couches. <br />
5 &para; Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, &ldquo;Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?&rdquo; <br />
6 &para; He answered and said to them, &ldquo;Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written:<br />

8 For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men&mdash;the washing of pitchers and cups, and many other such things you do.&rdquo;<br />
9 &para; He said to them, &ldquo;All too well you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.<br />
10 For Moses said, &ldquo;Honor your father and your mother&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.&rsquo;<br />
11 But you say, &ldquo;If a man says to his father or mother, &lsquo;Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban&rdquo;&mdash;&rsquo; (that is, a gift to God),<br />

13 making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.&rdquo;<br />
14 &para; When He had called all the multitude to Himself, He said to them, &ldquo;Hear Me, everyone, and understand:<br />
15 There is nothing that enters a man from outside which can defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are the things that defile a man.<br />
16 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!&rdquo;<br />
17 &para; When He had entered a house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable. <br />
18 So He said to them, &ldquo;Are you thus without understanding also? Do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,<br />
19 because it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and is eliminated, thus purifying all foods?&rdquo;<br />
20 And He said, &ldquo;What comes out of a man, that defiles a man.<br />
21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,<br />
22 thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.<br />
23 All these evil things come from within and defile a man.&rdquo;<br />

<p><b>The Pharisees washed their hands...a lot!</b> They acknowledge in this passage that the practice was &quot;the tradition of the elders.&quot; Literally, <b>it was part of the oral tradition that had been passed down.</b> This oral tradition is the equivalent of our federal judges issuing opinions regarding applications of our United States Constitution. These oral traditions were finally written down in the second century A.D. into what is known as the <b>Mishnah, a six-volume set of books.</b> By the fifth century the oral addendum to the Mishnah had grown into a <b>63-volume set of books known as the Talmud.</b> Try reading that through in a year!</p>
<p><b>This hand-washing ritual before meals, the violation of which the disciples were being criticized, had no basis in the Law of Moses.</b> However, since it was one of those very sacred extra-scriptural observances of these pious Jewish leaders, they were very critical. It was not a question of hygiene, but moral purity as far as they were concerned - <b>all man-made law. </b>Mark goes into more detail than Matthew regarding the background and basis of this Pharisaical practice of ritual washings in verses 2-5 of his account.</p>
	<p><b>How do you answer a stupid question?</b> I say &quot;stupid question&quot; because this hand-washing doctrine had no basis in Mosaic Law. it wasn't a sincere query...just the Pharisees trying to find fault with Jesus and his disciples. Jesus chooses another of their &quot;laws&quot; to show how they blatantly had been using their special supplement to the Law of Moses for selfish gain. On the one hand, they considered it their personal responsibility to <b>care for their parents in their old age.</b> As a matter of fact, Jesus mentions two laws regarding the treatment of parents - the fifth commandment found in <a href="2-17.html#Violence" title="Exodus 21 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 21:17 (see notes)</a>. </p>
	<p>But what if you were so selfish that you didn't want to take care of your parents. Here's the <b>loophole - called &quot;corban.&quot;</b> That's the Hebrew word for &quot;offering&quot; to God, used 82 times in the Old Testament in the context of sacrificial offerings/oblations brought to the Tabernacle/Temple; 78 of those times are found in Leviticus and Numbers. <b>Mark uses the exact Hebrew word (transliterated) in his account; he wants to make certain his readers understand exactly what loophole these hypocritical Pharisees are invoking.</b> However, they offered their possessions with a little bit of a twist. They would pledge their possessions to God (the temple) at their deaths with full rights to use their own wealth as long as they desired while they were living. However, (as they practiced it) <b>this pledge prevented them from giving away any of these possessions for any reason, including provisions for their parents in their old age</b> (or so they said). &quot;Sorry Mom and Dad - can't help - pledged all my possessions to God.&quot; Incidentally, what must your parents have done to you as a child to merit such treatment? What a loophole! Do you think that kind of hypocrisy and legal acrobatics will go unnoticed by Jesus? He immediately points out that Isaiah had prophesied this kind of conduct by a disobedient Jewish nation in <a title="Isaiah 29 Summary" href="9-28.html#Siege" target="_blank">Isaiah 29:13 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Therefore the Lord said: 	&ldquo;Inasmuch as these people draw near with their mouths 	And honor Me with their lips, 	But have removed their hearts far from Me, 	And their fear toward Me is taught by the commandment of men.&quot; Jesus quotes Isaiah in Matthew 15:9 when he says, &quot;And in vain they worship Me, <b>Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.</b>&quot; Wow! That's exactly what they were doing. And...I'm afraid that many religious people are still doing that today...just like Isaiah said they would...just like the Pharisees. <b>So, what happens when you mix tradition into your doctrine, giving it the same weight as scripture?</b> There's your answer in Mark 7:13, &quot;<strong>making the word of God of no effect through your tradition</strong> which you have handed down. And many such things you do.&quot;</p>
	<p><b>&quot;Hey Jesus! We think you insulted the Pharisees with this one,&quot;</b> the disciples reported in Matthew 15:12. Matthew, as an Apostle, would have been on the scene when this exchange took place. He recalls in his account the concern the disciples had with regard to how this conflict seemed to set with the hypocritical Jewish leaders. Does it appear that Jesus' disciples may have thought it better to compromise a little on this one? Obviously, they just didn't quite get it either. <b>Hygiene is good, but moral purity has nothing to do with ritually washing ones hands before eating</b> or the sanitary condition of substances taken into the body. Here's what defiles: that which proceeds from a man. <b>Here's the list of defiling conduct in Matthew 15:19 and Mark 7:21-22. </b></p>
		<p>Jesus uses &quot;heart&quot; (Greek: kardia) in this context the same way we use it in English today, figuratively as the seat of the emotions and as the seat of thought. No educated person in Jesus' day believed that thinking processes literally took place in the heart. Therefore, when Jesus refers to a defiled heart, he is speaking of one who stands in rebellion against God. This defilement is a product of the Adamic nature of man. In other words, <b>these Jewish leaders about whom Jesus was speaking did not have an authentic relationship with God.</b> That's the core problem Jesus is addressing here.</p>

		<p><b>Jesus is north of Israel up near Tyre and Sidon (in Syria) ministering. </b>This woman is of Canaanite descent according to Matthew, and Mark reports that she is a native of the Phoenician seaboard up in Syria (&quot;Syrophenician&quot;) - probably Greek in religion, and also in speech. She is quite perceptive when she cries out to Jesus, &quot;Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David.&quot; Matthew saw the exact phrasing of this plea to be significant. It demonstrated that she knew who Jesus was and why he had come...his Messianic mission. Jesus points out that his primary ministry is to present himself as Messiah to the Jews, and she's a gentile, not a Jew. She's persistent though - not really interested in technicalities. Could it be that she also understood that the prophet Isaiah had prophesied that the Messiah would also be ministering to Gentiles (<a title="Isaiah 54 Summary" href="10-9.html#Future" target="_blank">Isaiah 54, see notes</a>)? She's a quick thinker too - very fluent with the perfect rebuttal - the dogs-eating-crumbs rebuttal. As scavengers, dogs ate whatever wasn't consumed by the intended recipient. <b>Result: Jesus heals her daughter.</b></p>

<p>Jesus left Syria and is now ministering in Decapolis, southeast of the Sea of Galilee; this area was predominantly occupied by Greeks where Matthew simply reports that Jesus healed a &quot;multitude&quot; of people who were brought to him. Mark, on the other hand, recalls for us on that occasion the healing of one particular man, a deaf/dumb man. Mark gives a detailed account, including the Aramaic word (&quot;Ephphatha&quot;) Jesus uses when he commands that the man's ears &quot;be opened.&quot; The multitude is impressed and subsequently publish these miracles despite Jesus' plea that they not do so.</p>

<p>This crowd has been with Jesus for three days, and they're hungry - all 4,000 of them. Matthew points out that the 4,000 was just an accounting of the men present who were fed, not counting &quot;women and children.&quot; Look at the questions posed by the disciples in verse 33, &quot;Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to fill such a great multitude?&quot; Hey! Didn't you guys learn anything back in <a title="Matthew 14 Summary" href="3-6.html#Feeding" target="_blank">Matthew 14 (see notes)</a> when the 5,000+ were fed? Another feed miracle takes place from only seven loaves of bread and a few small fishes - with lots of leftovers.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this miracle, we see that Jesus took a ship to the other side of the Sea of Galilee when it is said in verse 39 that he &quot;came to the region of Magdala.&quot; Magdala was a city on the west coast of the Sea of Galilee (aka Sea of Tiberias). The events of this passage are immediately followed by those of <a title="Matthew 16; Mark 8 Summary" href="3-18.html#Top" target="_blank">Matthew 16; Mark 8:10-12 (see notes)</a>.</p>
