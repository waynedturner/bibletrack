<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Now it came to pass, when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, that he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings, and the altar and all its utensils; so he anointed them and consecrated them. <br />
2 Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers&rsquo; houses, who were the leaders of the tribes and over those who were numbered, made an offering. <br />
3 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two of the leaders, and for each one an ox; and they presented them before the tabernacle. <br />
4 &para; Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <br />
5 &ldquo;Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the work of the tabernacle of meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.&rdquo; <br />
6 So Moses took the carts and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites. <br />
7 Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service; <br />
8 and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the authority of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. <br />
9 But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because theirs was the service of the holy things, which they carried on their shoulders. <br />
10 &para; Now the leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed; so the leaders offered their offering before the altar. <br />
11 For the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;They shall offer their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar.&rdquo; <br />

<p><font size="3">Let's get started by putting this chapter into perspective with regard to <b>the correct time frame.</b> You will recall back in <a title="Exodus 40 Summary" href="2-27.html#Setup" target="_blank"><b>Exodus 40</b> (see notes)</a><b> that Moses took delivery of the Tabernacle, erected it and subsequently God filled it with his presence. </b>In this chapter we find the <b>dedication of that Tabernacle that immediately followed.</b> We see them rolling into camp in wagons. <b>Twelve princes in six wagons; they carpooled - two to a wagon.</b> The wagons and sacrifices were turned over to the priests for service. Of the Levites, the Gershonites received two of the wagons, the Merarites received the other four wagons. <b>The Kohathites got no wagons.</b> Why? It was because their responsibilities in moving the Tabernacle consisted of carrying the sacred vessels of the Tabernacle; these vessels were transported on foot, not wagons.</font></p>
<p>The Jewish holiday of Hanukkah celebrates the purification and rededication of the Jerusalem Temple by the Maccabees in the second century B.C. This is an eight-day celebration, and portions of the daily readings are taken from Numbers 7 because this chapter contains the record of the original dedication of the tabernacle.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>The presentation of the gifts to the priests (Numbers 7:12-83)<br>
				</b></font><b>First of all, let's recall the listing of the heads of the Tribes of Israel at the census that began in </b><a title="Numbers 1 Summary" href="3-13.html#Reckon" target="_blank"><b>Numbers 1</b> (see notes)</a> is not the same order in which they presented their offerings to the priests. Any significance? Upon closer inspection, you will recognize that they did so in the order in which they were positioned around the Tabernacle in their groups of three. <a title="Wilderness Arrangement" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/image/Tribes_wilderness.gif" target="_blank">(See the illustration of that arrangement)</a><b> They are listed in that order going clockwise around the tabernacle, beginning on the east side. </b></p>
<p>Each of the princes of the 12 Tribes of Israel brought the same gifts. Could this be the origin of the classic 12-place setting sold in stores everywhere to this day? Maybe not. <b>Every group of 6 verses from 12 to 83 provides the exact same description of items presented as follows:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>one silver platter weighing about 1.5 kilograms
  <li>one silver sprinkling bowl weighing about 0.8 kilogram
