<p><font size="3">In Matthew 9, Jesus has been ministering around the Sea of Galilee; he is still in that area. The actual effort is recorded in all three synoptic Gospels (<a href="#Jesus">see next section</a>), but the basis for the campaign is only recorded by Matthew in these four verses. The people came in great numbers to Jesus, but afterward verse 36 says of the people, &quot;they were weary and scattered.&quot; Both &quot;weary&quot; and &quot;scattered&quot; are perfect passive participles in their Greek form. Literally, that means that after hearing Jesus, they <i>were caused</i> to be weary (they were bullied) and they <i>were caused</i> to be scattered. Within a corrupt religious system as existed during that era, where do the people get spiritual nourishment after their encounter with Jesus. <b>The Jewish leadership cared nothing for the people; the people were just pawns who contributed to their power base.</b> This environment is the basis for the evangelistic effort that follows.</font></p>

		<p>From the verses leading up to these passages, we know that Jesus is still based at this time around the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. It is from this region that Jesus sends forth his twelve Apostles to minister.</p>
		<p><a name="Orders"></a><font size="3"><b>When Jesus sent his Apostles out on this occasion, look at the very specific marching orders he gave them in Matthew 10:5-7:</b></font></p>
<ol>
			<li><font size="3">Don't go to the Gentiles or Samaritans (only mentioned in Matthew 10:5).</font>
			<li><font size="3">Go to Israelites only (only mentioned in Matthew 10:6).</font>
			<li><font size="3">Preach the message, &quot;the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand&quot; (Matthew 10:7; Luke 9:2).</font>
		</ol>
		<p><b>Here's why this is important.</b> As we have commented regarding other passages in the Gospels, <b>Jesus came to offer to the Jews the fulfillment of the Messianic promises of the Old Testament prophets.</b> These promises consisted of the Kingdom of Israel restored to the earth, sovereign and worldwide. This Kingdom would have as its head the Messiah himself, and it would last forever. However, it had also been prophesied by Isaiah and Daniel that the Jews would reject the Messiah this time around and that he would be crucified (<a href="10-7.html#Isaiah" title="Isaiah 53 Summary" target="_blank">Isaiah 53, see notes</a>; <a href="12-12.html#Weeks" title="Daniel 9 Summary" target="_blank">Daniel 9:27, see notes</a>). Nonetheless, it was necessary that the ministry of Jesus and his Apostles make available to the Jews this Kingdom on earth.</p>
	<p><b>Only Matthew takes this occasion to name the twelve Apostles:</b></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Simon, who is called Peter
			<li>Andrew his brother
			<li>James the son of Zebedee
			<li>John his brother
			<li>Philip
			<li>Bartholomew
			<li>Thomas
			<li>Matthew the publican
			<li>James the son of Alphaeus
			<li>Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus
			<li>Simon the Canaanite
			<li>Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 
		</ol>
		<p>We also find a listing of the twelve in two parallel passages, <a title="Mark 3 and Luke 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=01&dy=29#Apostles" target="_blank">Mark 3:13-19 and Luke 6:12-16 (see notes)</a>.</p>
		<p>Look at the marching orders found in Matthew 10:8, &quot;Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.&quot; <b>Is this mandate for all Believers throughout all generations, or was this a special unction given to them by Jesus for this particular evangelistic effort?</b> Mark and Luke seem to shed light on this. Mark simply says, &quot;and gave them power over unclean spirits&quot; while Luke reports, &quot;and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.&quot; In other words, here's the question: <b>Are we leaving something out of our evangelistic message today if we don't fulfill Matthew 10:8 when we evangelize?</b> The answer is contextually simple. <b>Nobody assumes that we have been committed to the criteria of Matthew 10:5-7</b> (<a href="#Orders">see above</a>), the three verses that precede verse 8. Therefore, if we acknowledge that these criteria are specifically for this campaign, then it would be contextually dishonest to insist that verse 8 should be treated any differently. <b>Context - it's very important!</b></p>
	<p>One more thing: A vow of poverty is a key component in this campaign - specifically stated in all three accounts as part of the mission. You don't typically see the people who proclaim that verse 8 applies to all evangelism in all ages embracing this vow-of-poverty lifestyle. Notice Matthew 10:14-15 and Mark 6:11...and what if they are not well received? <b>Can you say, &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah?&quot;</b> <a href="1-24.html#Neighbors" title="Genesis 19 Summary" target="_blank">(For details on Sodom and Gomorrah, click here to read the notes on Genesis 19.)</a></p>
	<p><b>Notice how much insight regarding this mission is gained when all three passages are studied together.</b> When either the account of Mark or Luke is taken without the support of the other two, certain important details are missing. One cannot really grasp the mission without considering the details given in all three accounts. However, Mark's account does seem to differ from that of Matthew and Luke on one point&hellip;to carry or not carry a staff. Mark says &quot;yes&quot; to a walking staff. Matthew and Luke say &quot;no&quot; to &quot;staffs&quot; (KJV: staves). The Greek word there is ῥά&beta;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf; (rhabdos). It's a general word for a rod that might have had several uses back then. Nearly everyone carried a walking staff for long journeys. Matthew and Luke both use the plural. It would appear that Mark is saying that Jesus commanded the only kind of staff that should accompany them is a walking staff. No other kind of staff that might be used as a tool for one's trade was to be carried. Thus, the usage of the plural &quot;staffs&quot; (KJV: staves) by Matthew and Luke should be understood in this context.</p>

	<p><font size="3">In this passage <b>Jesus continues his instructions to his Apostles.</b> Mark and Luke do not report on these extended commissioning comments by Jesus. He makes some startling statements throughout this passage, but <b>let's make sure we keep it in its proper context.</b> Jesus is still giving instructions to his Apostles concerning their <b>preaching the Kingdom message.</b> Note particularly the reference to their &quot;synagogues&quot; in verse 17. He carefully and thoroughly warns them that their message will not be well received. <b>We already know how this ends - the rejection of Jesus as Messiah and his subsequent crucifixion.</b> However, it was prophesied that this Kingdom would be offered, and here it is being offered. That being the case, how do we render the warnings issued by Jesus in this passage? <b>Are these warnings just for the Apostles as they are charged here, or are they to be universally applied to all Believers who proclaim the name of Jesus - then and now?</b> Certainly we see that persecution was not restricted to just this era, but there's a certain urgency here with this particular commissioning. </font></p>
	<p>Jesus refers to the accusation against him in verse 25 that had occurred in <a href="2-14.html#Jewish" title="Mark 3 Summary" target="_blank">Mark 3:22 (see notes)</a>. It was there that Jesus was accused of performing miracles in the name of Beelzebub, regarded in that day as the chief demon aka Satan himself.</p>
	<p><b>There is an intense discipleship call here.</b> As we know in retrospect, the <b>time was very limited</b> at this point in the ministry of Jesus. <b>When people take the discipleship call in this passage and universally apply it to all Believers today, they usually find that they have to massage the words a little bit to make them palatable to what we know to be true about priorities in one's Christian life.</b> Look at Matthew 10:34, &quot;Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword.&quot; <b>The Kingdom message was divisive, ultimately leading to the crucifixion</b>. Now observe Matthew 10:35, &quot;For I have come to &ldquo;set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.&quot; That verse can only be truly appreciated in light of the urgency of the hour and the Kingdom message. <b>What Jesus was calling upon people to do during this time was to drop everything they were doing, disregard family ties and close personal relationships and prepare for the immediate fulfillment of the Kingdom reign as prophesied in the Old Testament.</b> Think of it like this: If you knew that a hurricane was headed your way and would arrive at some point in the next few days, wouldn't there be urgent tasks to do that would overshadow family time, work, leisure activities, etc.? Certainly! That's the kind of urgency in these instructions from Jesus to his Apostles on this occasion. So, here Jesus is talking about <b>drop-everything-else discipleship.</b> Context is important here. Many Believers have understood these verses as a mandate to forsake family and friends to pursue the ministry. They lose sight of the special circumstances of the context. Now while there are certainly lessons to be learned from this passage, a strict adherence here by Believers today often leaves them with feelings of failure and inadequacy.<b> Incidentally, this campaign by Jesus' Apostles ends in </b><a title="Matthew 14:13; Mark 6:30-32; Luke 9:10 Summary" href="3-6.html#Apostles" target="_blank"><b>Matthew 14:13, Mark 6:30-32 and Luke 9:10</b> (see notes)</a><b>. In those verses they report back to Jesus the results of their evangelistic efforts under this mandate.</b></p>
	<p>Now...here's a verse that is frequently abused by those who paint salvation as a conditional state rather than what it is, an unconditional covenant between God and the Believer. Notice verse 22, &quot;And you will be hated by all for My name&rsquo;s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.&quot; Before you try to make this verse apply to something that it does not, read the preceding verse (21) to see the saved-from-what detail - unquestionably, physical death (&quot;put to death&quot;). To whom does the guarantee of verse 22 apply? He's still addressing the twelve specifically regarding how to succeed in this evangelistic campaign. Here's what Jesus tells them: Don't back off this mission because of persecution and threat of death; keep on task and you will not be killed (i.e. &quot;saved&quot;). As a matter of fact, all of the twelve returned safe and sound after this road trip.</p>
	<p>One more point of interest in this passage. Notice the love-'em and leave-'em aspect of the command to preach here. He tells them not to stick around (verse 23) after they have preached to a city. Don't continue to work the city; just move on. And when they go to a city, some will accept, and some will reject (verses 32-33). When you understand the context, these verses make sense, don't they? If missionaries today strictly adhered to this principle, many areas of the world would never be evangelized. <b>One more time: CONTEXT, CONTEXT, CONTEXT!</b></p>
