<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Now the men of Ephraim said to him, &ldquo;Why have you done this to us by not calling us when you went to fight with the Midianites?&rdquo; And they reprimanded him sharply. <br />
2 &para; So he said to them, &ldquo;What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? <br />
3 God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And what was I able to do in comparison with you?&rdquo; Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now they want to help! Where have they been for the last 7 years of oppression? These leaders of Ephraim complain to Gideon about the fact that they were not called upon to supply troops in <a title="Judges 6 Summary" href="5-2.html#Steamed" target="_blank">Judges 6:28-35 (see notes)</a>. They were called upon for clean-up operations in <a title="Judges 7 Summary" href="5-2.html#Panic" target="_blank">Judges 7:19-25 (see notes)</a> and were responsible for catching and executing those pesky Midianite princes, Oreb and Zeeb. In verse 2, Gideon's a gentleman about their challenge and uses a harvesting-grapes metaphor to describe their actions compared to his; he compliments their bravery, and because of Gideon's diplomacy, they drop the whole issue.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Succoth, Penuel! Is that a yellow streak I see? (Judges 8:4-9)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">4 &para; When Gideon came to the Jordan, he and the three hundred men who were with him crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit. <br />
5 Then he said to the men of Succoth, &ldquo;Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.&rdquo; <br />
6 &para; And the leaders of Succoth said, &ldquo;Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?&rdquo; <br />
7 &para; So Gideon said, &ldquo;For this cause, when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers!&rdquo; <br />
8 Then he went up from there to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way. And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. <br />
9 So he also spoke to the men of Penuel, saying, &ldquo;When I come back in peace, I will tear down this tower!&rdquo; <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">These two cities were about 4.5 miles apart (Succoth and Penuel) located in the territory of the Tribe of Gad just east of the Jordan River, about 25 miles southeast of the battle at Jezreel in </font><a title="Judges 6 Summary" href="5-2.html#Steamed" target="_blank">Judges 6:28-35 (see notes)</a><font size="3">. The cowardly Midianites (15,000 of them) had headed that way. </font>These Gadites just had no confidence that Gideon and his band of 300 could finish off the enemy.<b> I mean...300 men in pursuit of 15,000 - what are the chances you'll see these 300 men again?</b> These cowardly fellow Jews in verse 6 ask, &quot;Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?&quot; That's a reference to the two Midianite kings Gideon is pursuing. </p>
<p>So, these fellow Jews refuse provisions to Gideon for fear of reprisal from the Midianites if they do so. Bad news guys! When Gideon returns after taking care of that army, you'll meet those two kings...in the hands of Gideon; you're in for a very unpleasant surprise. Gideon threatens the leadership of both cities with a very unpleasant means of capital punishment when he says in verse 7, &quot;I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers!&quot; He also adds this guarantee to Penuel in verse 9, saying, &quot;When I come back in peace, I will tear down this tower!&quot; Despite the threats, neither city is moved to cooperate with Gideon by these threats. </p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Gideon's band of 300 - Awesome! (Judges 8:10-21)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">10 &para; Now Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East; for one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen. <br />
11 Then Gideon went up by the road of those who dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah; and he attacked the army while the camp felt secure. <br />
12 When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army. <br />
13 &para; Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle, from the Ascent of Heres. <br />
14 And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth and interrogated him; and he wrote down for him the leaders of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men. <br />
15 Then he came to the men of Succoth and said, &ldquo;Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you ridiculed me, saying, &lsquo;Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your weary men?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />
16 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. <br />
17 Then he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city. <br />
18 &para; And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, &ldquo;What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?&rdquo; &para; So they answered, &ldquo;As you are, so were they; each one resembled the son of a king.&rdquo; <br />
19 &para; Then he said, &ldquo;They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.&rdquo; <br />
20 And he said to Jether his firstborn, &ldquo;Rise, kill them!&rdquo; But the youth would not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth. <br />
21 &para; So Zebah and Zalmunna said, &ldquo;Rise yourself, and kill us; for as a man is, so is his strength.&rdquo; So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels&rsquo; necks. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, after having defeated 120,000 with his band of 300 (<a href="5-2.html#Force" title="Judges 7 Summary" target="_blank">Judges 7, see notes</a>), he goes after the remaining 15,000 that had fled and captures their two kings. <b>Now, it's back to his fellow Jewish brethren in Succoth and Penuel with the two enemy kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, in tow.</b> Hey Succoth and Penuel! Are these the two kings you thought we couldn't defeat? Those folks had bet on the wrong horse (so to speak). <b>Gideon collects from these cowards - IN BLOOD.</b> Gideon's actions may seem excessive here, but God had appointed Gideon to be the battle commander, and the men of these two cities aided the enemies of not only Gideon, but God himself. Traitors don't usually get favorable treatment...in anyone's army. Oh...and the two captured kings - they admit to having killed Gideon's brothers. If there was any thought of letting these guys live, this admission pretty much negates that idea. Gideon's son (Jether) is not fond of the notion of avenging his uncles, so Gideon himself does the honors.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>A golden ephod beats ruling (Judges 8:22-28)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">22 &para; Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, &ldquo;Rule over us, both you and your son, and your grandson also; for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.&rdquo; <br />
23 &para; But Gideon said to them, &ldquo;I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.&rdquo; <br />
24 Then Gideon said to them, &ldquo;I would like to make a request of you, that each of you would give me the earrings from his plunder.&rdquo; For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites. <br />
25 &para; So they answered, &ldquo;We will gladly give them.&rdquo; And they spread out a garment, and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder. <br />
26 Now the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments, pendants, and purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were around their camels&rsquo; necks. <br />
27 Then Gideon made it into an ephod and set it up in his city, Ophrah. And all Israel played the harlot with it there. It became a snare to Gideon and to his house. <br />
28 &para; Thus Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted their heads no more. And the country was quiet for forty years in the days of Gideon. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Israel's pretty tickled that Gideon has delivered them from the Midianites; they roll out the red carpet (metaphorically speaking). They offer him what sounds like a kingship to me, but he refuses. Instead, he asks for the earrings from the captured booty. <b>He then makes a replica of the high priests apron (ephod) and puts it on display in his hometown of Ophrah.</b> Why? Was he trying to compete with Shiloh (where the ark of the covenant was located) as an alternative place of worship? Who knows, but it did become problematic (verse 27); it seems those Hebrews were willing to worship just about anything. However, Gideon's brave leadership had brought Israel 40 years of peace.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Gideon dies, and it's back to the idols (Judges 8:29-35)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">29 &para; Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. <br />
30 Gideon had seventy sons who were his own offspring, for he had many wives. <br />
31 And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech. <br />
32 Now Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. <br />
33 &para; So it was, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals, and made Baal-Berith their god. <br />
34 Thus the children of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side; <br />
35 nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (Gideon) in accordance with the good he had done for Israel. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those Hebrews loved nicknames. You know how the bald guy always gets called &quot;curly,&quot; and the big guy gets called &quot;tiny.&quot; Well, <b>Gideon's nickname was &quot;Jerubbaal&quot;</b> (Aren't nicknames supposed to be shorter?). &quot;Jerubbaal&quot; means &quot;let Baal fight for himself.&quot; He got that nickname back in <a title="Judges 6 Summary" href="5-2.html#Steamed" target="_blank">Judges 6:32 (see notes)</a> when he tore down the altar to Baal. <b>So, what happens when Gideon finally dies? It's back to Baal for the people, and they show no respect whatsoever to Gideon's memory.</b></p>
<p><b>One more key point about Gideon is found in verse 30, &quot;Gideon had seventy sons who were his own offspring, for he had many wives.&quot; </b>That's not counting daughters. An additional son is seen in verse 31; Abimelech was born to a concubine of Gideon who lived in Shechem, about six miles from Gideon's hometown of Ophrah. We're not told that any of the other brothers and sisters lived in Shechem - just Abimelech. He goes for a power grab in chapter 9.</p>
<p><a name="Brotherly"></a><font size="4"><b>Brotherly love turns sour! (Judges 9:1-21)<br>

		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 Then Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to his mother&rsquo;s brothers, and spoke with them and with all the family of the house of his mother&rsquo;s father, saying, <br />
2 &ldquo;Please speak in the hearing of all the men of Shechem: &lsquo;Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal reign over you, or that one reign over you?&rsquo; Remember that I am your own flesh and bone.&rdquo; <br />
3 &para; And his mother&rsquo;s brothers spoke all these words concerning him in the hearing of all the men of Shechem; and their heart was inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, &ldquo;He is our brother.&rdquo; <br />
4 So they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men; and they followed him. <br />
5 Then he went to his father&rsquo;s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, because he hid himself. <br />
6 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, all of Beth Millo, and they went and made Abimelech king beside the terebinth tree at the pillar that was in Shechem. <br />
7 &para; Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and cried out. And he said to them:<br />
&ldquo;Listen to me, you men of Shechem,<br />
That God may listen to you! <br />
8 	&ldquo;The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them.<br />
And they said to the olive tree,<br />
&lsquo;Reign over us!&rsquo; <br />
9 	But the olive tree said to them,<br />
&ldquo;Should I cease giving my oil,<br />
With which they honor God and men,<br />
And go to sway over trees?&rsquo; <br />
10 	&ldquo;Then the trees said to the fig tree,<br />
&lsquo;You come and reign over us!&rsquo; <br />
11 	But the fig tree said to them,<br />
&ldquo;Should I cease my sweetness and my good fruit,<br />
And go to sway over trees?&rsquo; <br />
12 	&ldquo;Then the trees said to the vine,<br />
&lsquo;You come and reign over us!&rsquo; <br />
13 	But the vine said to them,<br />
&ldquo;Should I cease my new wine,<br />
Which cheers both God and men,<br />
And go to sway over trees?&rsquo; <br />
14 	&ldquo;Then all the trees said to the bramble,<br />
&lsquo;You come and reign over us!&rsquo; <br />
15 	And the bramble said to the trees,<br />
&ldquo;If in truth you anoint me as king over you,<br />
Then come and take shelter in my shade;<br />
But if not, let fire come out of the bramble<br />
And devour the cedars of Lebanon!&rsquo; <br />
16 &para; &ldquo;Now therefore, if you have acted in truth and sincerity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him as he deserves&mdash; <br />
17 for my father fought for you, risked his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian; <br />
18 but you have risen up against my father&rsquo;s house this day, and killed his seventy sons on one stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother&mdash; <br />
19 if then you have acted in truth and sincerity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. <br />
20 But if not, let fire come from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and Beth Millo; and let fire come from the men of Shechem and from Beth Millo and devour Abimelech!&rdquo; <br />
21 And Jotham ran away and fled; and he went to Beer and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother. <br />
          </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Some brother, huh? Gideon's son, Abimelech, goes for a power grab, kills 69 of 70 of his brothers and grabs the kingship of Shechem (his mom's hometown). That must have just been a starting place for Abimelech; he must have had his eyes on a bigger kingship, but you gotta start somewhere. Gideon had a bunch of wives and concubines and subsequently, sons. The sole surviving brother, <b>Jotham, tells it like it is to the leaders of Shechem from the top of the Mount Gerizim</b> (remember, that was that blessings mountain of <a title="Joshua 8 Summary" href="4-21.html#Event" target="_blank">Joshua 8, see photo</a>). Shechem was in the valley at the foot of the mountain. He hollers out the whole ruthless truth about his power-hungry brother, Abimelech. One could stand on the top of that mountain and broadcast clearly and loudly into Shechem beneath. He then high tails it for his life after speaking his peace.</p>
		<p>Jotham speaks to the men of Shechem by giving them a parable in verses 7-15. His olive tree/fig tree parable didn't flow that well...kinda hard to follow. It's a good thing he gives the interpretation of his parable in verses 16-20. <strong>It is important to notice the curse that Jotham pronounces on Abimelech and the men of Shechem (verse 20). It took three years, but this curse finally is fulfilled and noted so in verse 57.</strong></p>
<p><a name="Abimelech"></a><font size="4"><b>Abimelech, killed by a woman (Judges 9:22-57)<br>
			</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="2">22 &para; After Abimelech had reigned over Israel three years, <br />
23 God sent a spirit of ill will between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, <br />
24 that the crime done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be settled and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who aided him in the killing of his brothers. <br />
25 And the men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was told Abimelech. <br />
26 &para; Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. <br />
27 So they went out into the fields, and gathered grapes from their vineyards and trod them, and made merry. And they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. <br />
28 Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, &ldquo;Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? <br />
29 If only this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech.&rdquo; So he said to Abimelech, &ldquo;Increase your army and come out!&rdquo; <br />
30 &para; When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was aroused. <br />
31 And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, &ldquo;Take note! Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and here they are, fortifying the city against you. <br />
32 Now therefore, get up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field. <br />
33 And it shall be, as soon as the sun is up in the morning, that you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may then do to them as you find opportunity.&rdquo; <br />
34 &para; So Abimelech and all the people who were with him rose by night, and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies. <br />
35 When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate, Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from lying in wait. <br />
36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, &ldquo;Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!&rdquo; &para; But Zebul said to him, &ldquo;You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.&rdquo; <br />
37 &para; So Gaal spoke again and said, &ldquo;See, people are coming down from the center of the land, and another company is coming from the Diviners&rsquo; Terebinth Tree.&rdquo; <br />
38 &para; Then Zebul said to him, &ldquo;Where indeed is your mouth now, with which you said, &lsquo;Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?&rsquo; Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out, if you will, and fight with them now.&rdquo; <br />
39 &para; So Gaal went out, leading the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. <br />
40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled from him; and many fell wounded, to the very entrance of the gate. <br />
41 Then Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, so that they would not dwell in Shechem. <br />
42 &para; And it came about on the next day that the people went out into the field, and they told Abimelech. <br />
43 So he took his people, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field. And he looked, and there were the people, coming out of the city; and he rose against them and attacked them. <br />
44 Then Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city; and the other two companies rushed upon all who were in the fields and killed them. <br />
45 So Abimelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city and killed the people who were in it; and he demolished the city and sowed it with salt. <br />
46 &para; Now when all the men of the tower of Shechem had heard that, they entered the stronghold of the temple of the god Berith. <br />
47 And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. <br />
48 Then Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it and laid it on his shoulder; then he said to the people who were with him, &ldquo;What you have seen me do, make haste and do as I have done.&rdquo; <br />
49 So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech, put them against the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire above them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women. <br />
50 &para; Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he encamped against Thebez and took it. <br />
51 But there was a strong tower in the city, and all the men and women&mdash;all the people of the city&mdash;fled there and shut themselves in; then they went up to the top of the tower. <br />
52 So Abimelech came as far as the tower and fought against it; and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire. <br />
53 But a certain woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech&rsquo;s head and crushed his skull. <br />
54 Then he called quickly to the young man, his armorbearer, and said to him, &ldquo;Draw your sword and kill me, lest men say of me, &lsquo;A woman killed him.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; So his young man thrust him through, and he died. <br />
55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed, every man to his place. <br />
56 &para; Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers. <br />
57 And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned on their own heads, and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal. </font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">It's difficult to say with certainty, but it seems that maybe the whole of Israel had acknowledged Abimelech's kingship (verse 22), or perhaps just the half tribe of Manasseh and Ephraim. </font>We actually don't see his influence in Israel beyond that localized region of Israel. He didn't reign very long before <b>the challenge in Shechem by a guy named Gaal</b>...and the whole town of Shechem fell in right behind Gaal. Abimelech feels he can't let that challenge stand, so he organizes all-out warfare against this town. When the people of the city gather in their pagan temple (house of Berith - verse 46) which was a secure building in the city, Abimelech and his army burn it down with the people inside, killing about a thousand. </p>
<p>While he's on a roll, Abimelech heads north about 12 miles to a neighboring city of conspirators called Thebez. As the people there gather in their tower, Abimelech prepares to burn it down with the people inside. He encounters a little glitch in his battle plan though; a woman drops a kitchen utensil (a millstone) on his head.<b> As he lay there dying, his departing thoughts are, &quot;OH, NO! DON'T LET ME DIE AT THE HAND OF A WOMAN!&quot;</b> With that plea, one of his loyal men runs him through with a sword to put him out of his misery. GOOD RIDDANCE King Abimelech! <b>Oh...and by the way King Abimelech...we all know it was a woman who really killed you.</b> We see in verse 57 that Abimelech died according to the curse of Jotham in verse 20; his own townspeople did turn against him.</p>
<p>After Abimelech's death, the army that supported him scattered, thereby ending the first attempt to establish a king over Israel.<b><br>
