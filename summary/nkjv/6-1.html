	<p><font size="3">This Psalm appears to be written by David, but that is not certain. </font>He prays to God to be restored to fellowship. It is noteworthy to see that he depends on God as he prays when he beckons him to &quot;plead my cause against an ungodly nation.&quot; The Hebrew word translated &quot;nation&quot; here may refer to non-Jewish hostilities, but not necessarily. The reference to &quot;holy hill&quot; in verse 3 is most likely a direct reference to Jerusalem. It is used in that context in <a href="6-15.html#Ark" target="_blank">II Samuel 6, see notes</a>).</p>

The deeds You did in their days,<br>
In days of old: <br>
2 	You drove out the nations with Your hand,<br>
But them You planted;<br>
You afflicted the peoples, and cast them out. <br>
3 	For they did not gain possession of the land by their own sword,<br>
Nor did their own arm save them;<br>

10 	You make us turn back from the enemy,<br>

19 	But You have severely broken us in the place of jackals,<br>
And covered us with the shadow of death. <br>

    <p>This Psalm focuses on a time of national peril, but the author is unknown...maybe David. Here he expresses national despair and even questions why God has allowed a rejection of his people when they are not involved in wrongdoing. We can't know for sure where in Israel's history this Psalm might have been written, but it's a nationally-dark period - even if for a short while. Verse 26 does express the Psalmist's confidence in God's provision, however. Paul quotes verse 22 in <a title="Romans 8 Summary" href="8-17.html#Line" target="_blank">Romans 8:36 (see notes)</a> when he says, &quot;As it is written: 	'For Your sake we are killed all day long; 		We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.'&quot;</p>
    <p>Incidentally, the <b>sons of Korah</b> are mentioned in the subtitle. The Korahites are first listed in <a title="Numbers 26 Summary" href="7-15.html#Temple" title="I Chronicles 26 Summary" target="_blank">I Chronicles 26:1 (see notes)</a> and are listed in the subtitles of 11 different Psalms. Perhaps they were keepers of the praise music.</p>

		    1 &para; 	My heart is overflowing with a good theme;<br>
I recite my composition concerning the King;<br>
My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. <br>
2 	You are fairer than the sons of men;<br>
Grace is poured upon Your lips;<br>
Therefore God has blessed You forever. <br>
3 	Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O Mighty One,<br>
With Your glory and Your majesty. <br>
4 	And in Your majesty ride prosperously because of truth, humility, and righteousness;<br>
And Your right hand shall teach You awesome things. <br>
5 	Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the King&rsquo;s enemies;<br>
The peoples fall under You. <br>
6 	Your throne, O God, is forever and ever;<br>

7 	You love righteousness and hate wickedness;<br>

Out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad. <br>

Forget your own people also, and your father&rsquo;s house; <br>
11 	So the King will greatly desire your beauty;<br>
Because He is your Lord, worship Him. <br>
12 	And the daughter of Tyre will come with a gift;<br>
The rich among the people will seek your favor. <br>
13 	The royal daughter is all glorious within the palace;<br>
Her clothing is woven with gold. <br>
14 	She shall be brought to the King in robes of many colors;<br>

15 	With gladness and rejoicing they shall be brought;<br>

Whom You shall make princes in all the earth. <br>
17 	I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations;<br>
Therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><font size="3">Although the authorship of this Psalm is unknown, this certainly looks like a special-occasion song written for the ceremony of a royal couple - perhaps for David himself. As a matter of fact, notice verses 16-17, &quot;Instead of Your fathers shall be Your sons, Whom You shall make princes in all the earth.  I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.&quot; That surely is a reference to the longevity of the Davidic throne based upon the provisions of the <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Davidic_Covenant.html" title="Davidic Covenant" target="_blank">Davidic Covenant (see notes)</a>.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">You will notice a reference in this Psalm as well to the &quot;sons of Korah&quot; and &quot;Contemplation&quot; as well (<a href="#Rejected">see notes on Psalm 44 above</a>). In addition, another word is found in the subtitle here, &quot;Shoshannim,&quot; the Hebrew word for &quot;lily.&quot; Furthermore, we see there &quot;A song of loves.&quot; So...what does it all mean?</font></p>
	<p><b>Following is an excerpt from the Expositor's Bible Commentary regarding this Psalm:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The psalm is a royal psalm and functioned as a wedding song at the occasion of the wedding of a royal couple. Because of the theological significance of the wedding and the function of the Davidic king within God&#146;s order of life in Israel and Judah, the wedding song takes on typological significance. Applicable to any descendant of David, it extols the privileged position of his people and sets forth God&#146;s expectations of his appointed vassal on earth (cf. Psalms 2; 110).</p>

4 	I will incline my ear to a proverb;<br>
I will disclose my dark saying on the harp. <br>
5 	Why should I fear in the days of evil,<br>
When the iniquity at my heels surrounds me? <br>

8 	For the redemption of their souls is costly,<br>
And it shall cease forever&mdash; <br>
9 	That he should continue to live eternally,<br>

And leave their wealth to others. <br>
11 	Their inner thought is that their houses will last forever,<br>
Their dwelling places to all generations;<br>
They call their lands after their own names. <br>
12 	Nevertheless man, though in honor, does not remain;<br>
He is like the beasts that perish. <br>
13 	This is the way of those who are foolish,<br>
And of their posterity who approve their sayings.<br>
Selah<br>
14 	Like sheep they are laid in the grave;<br>
Death shall feed on them;<br>
The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;<br>
And their beauty shall be consumed in the grave, far from their dwelling. <br>
15 	But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave,<br>
For He shall receive me.<br>
Selah<br>
16 	Do not be afraid when one becomes rich,<br>

17 	For when he dies he shall carry nothing away;<br>
His glory shall not descend after him. <br>
18 	Though while he lives he blesses himself<br>

19 	He shall go to the generation of his fathers;<br>
They shall never see light. <br>
20 	A man who is in honor, yet does not understand,<br>
Is like the beasts that perish. </font></p>

    <p><font size="3">We don't know who wrote this Psalm...perhaps David. We see in verse 1 that this is an instructive Psalm rather than one designed to give praise to God, &quot;Hear this, all peoples; Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,&quot; </font>Of course, David was rich. In this Psalm the Psalmist deals with the folly of trusting in your riches rather than God. Though one might have wealth, he is unable to use that wealth for direct eternal intervention as we see in verse 7, &quot;None of them can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him.&quot; He expresses his confidence in eternal life in verse 15, an issue not dealt with frequently in the Old Testament. Notice verse 17, &quot;For when he dies he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him.&quot; Perhaps Paul had this verse in mind when he wrote in <a title="I Timothy 6 Summary" href="10-28.html#Rich" target="_blank">I Timothy 6:7 (see notes)</a>, &quot;For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.&quot; While David (if he is the author) is poetic, Paul gets right to the point.</p>

<p><font size="3">The author is not known on this one. In the subtitle, Gath is a musical term of uncertain meaning. Perhaps it is a musical instrument. It is used in the subtitle of three different Psalms. Here, t</font>he Psalmist longs for God's dwelling place.

<p>The words of this Psalm have led many scholars to place its writing at the time of the return from Babylonian exile. The references to a return to the land do make sense in that context, and David is not named as its author. You may recall in Ezra and Nehemiah how zealous for God the people of Israel were during this period. <a href="5-31.html" title="I Chronicles Summary" target="_blank">Click here to see the introduction to I Chronicles for more insight into this era. </a>However, perhaps it is prophetic from David himself. No one knows for certain.</p>

<p>It's the city God founded, and there is no city like it on the earth. Jerusalem is presented here as a city of prestige. &quot;Holy mountains&quot; (verse 1), &quot;Zion&quot; (verse 2) and &quot;city of God&quot; (verse 3) are all distinct references to Jerusalem as the center of worship. The name &quot;Rahab&quot; in verse 4 is a reference to Egypt as it is also in <a href="6-15.html#Ark" target="_blank">II Samuel 6, see notes</a>). This Psalm goes prophetic in verse 3, indicating the future glory of Jerusalem as the central city of the world. This is certainly a reference to the fact that prophetic writings and utterances from the prophets place Jerusalem as the point on the earth from which the Messiah will reign and the Davidic throne will be established.</p>
