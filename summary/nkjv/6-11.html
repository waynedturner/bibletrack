<p>David is crowned King of Israel at Hebron where he rules over a portion of Israel for 7 1/2 years - not the whole thing (II Samuel 5:5). Actually, according to <a title="II Samuel 2 Summary" href="5-28.html#Kings" target="_blank">II Samuel 2 (see notes)</a>, it was just the Tribe of Judah that made him king initially. Saul's grandson Ishbosheth was appointed king over the rest. We get our bearings here from II Samuel 2:10, &quot;Ishbosheth, Saul&rsquo;s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.&quot; There's a lapse of 5 1/2 years here between the death of Ishbosheth (<a title="II Samuel 4 Summary" href="5-28.html#Ishbosheth" target="_blank">II Samuel 4:1-12, see notes</a>) until the Northern Tribes come to David to take him as their king as well. This action seems to be prompted by the anticipated capture of Jerusalem from the Jebusites. Notice that the Northern Tribes acknowledge that God had appointed David as king; so...what took them so long to come around?</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is David's third anointing as king. Samuel chose and anointed him in <a title="I Samuel 16 Summary" href="5-16.html#Call" target="_blank">I Samuel 16:13 (see notes)</a>. Judah accepted him as their king, and he was anointed in <a title="II Samuel 2 Summary" href="5-28.html#Kings" target="_blank">II Samuel 2:2 (see notes)</a>. Now, here we have David being anointed over all of Israel. Sometimes good things take awhile!</p>

		<p>The Jebusites live in Jerusalem and felt their city was invincible. II Samuel 5:8 seems to be the boast of the Jebusites that their city was so secure, it could be defended by lame and blind people. David says, &quot;Let's take it.&quot; Joab made a name for himself here and became David's go-to man by taking Jerusalem. So much for invincibility! It appears that perhaps Joab entered the city through their water supply (gutter, conduit, spout - II Samuel 5:8). Obviously the Jebusites were expecting an assault on the wall instead. Out with the Jebusites and in with the Jews. It became known as the City of David. The city was repaired and expanded under David.</p>
	<p><strong>This marks the end of Hebron being the de facto capital of Israel.</strong> David has his house built in Jerusalem, and it becomes the new capital, sometimes referred to as Zion. It should be noted, however, the Jebusites were not all driven from Jerusalem. Later (<a title="II Samuel 24 Summary" href="7-10.html#Nothing" target="_blank">II Samuel 24:18-25, see notes</a>), David buys the property for the new temple from Araunah, a Jebusite.</p>

		  <p><font size="2">10 &para; Now these were the heads of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. <br />
11 &para; And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite, chief of the captains; he had lifted up his spear against three hundred, killed by him at one time. <br />
12 &para; After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. <br />
13 He was with David at Pasdammim. Now there the Philistines were gathered for battle, and there was a piece of ground full of barley. So the people fled from the Philistines. <br />
14 But they stationed themselves in the middle of that field, defended it, and killed the Philistines. So the LORD brought about a great victory. <br />
15 &para; Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. <br />
16 David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. <br />
17 And David said with longing, &ldquo;Oh, that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!&rdquo; <br />
18 So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless David would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD. <br />
19 And he said, &ldquo;Far be it from me, O my God, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.&rdquo; Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men. <br />
20 &para; Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of another three. He had lifted up his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name among these three. <br />
21 Of the three he was more honored than the other two men. Therefore he became their captain. However he did not attain to the first three. <br />
22 &para; Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He had killed two lion-like heroes of Moab. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day. <br />
23 And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great height, five cubits tall. In the Egyptian&rsquo;s hand there was a spear like a weaver&rsquo;s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptian&rsquo;s hand, and killed him with his own spear. <br />
24 These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among three mighty men. <br />
25 Indeed he was more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. And David appointed him over his guard. <br />
26 &para; Also the mighty warriors were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, <br />
27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, <br />
28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, <br />
29 Sibbechai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, <br />
30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, <br />
31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, <br />
32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, <br />
33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, <br />
34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shageh the Hararite, <br />
35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, <br />
36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, <br />
37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, <br />
38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, <br />
39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite (the armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah), <br />
40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, <br />
41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, <br />
42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite (a chief of the Reubenites) and thirty with him, <br />
43 Hanan the son of Maachah, Joshaphat the Mithnite, <br />
44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, <br />
45 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, <br />

	<p>When you got a big job and need a good man to take care of it for you, who you gonna call? David had his group of mighty men. Ezra, here in I Chronicles, adds a few to the list of men also found in <a title="II Samuel 23 Summary" href="7-7.html#David" target="_blank">II Samuel 23:8-39 (see notes)</a>. An interesting episode is listed here regarding three of David's mighty men that fulfill his casual wish that he could have a drink of water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem. These three risk their lives to retrieve this water for David from behind Philistine enemy lines. Upon their return, David is overwhelmed with this act, but pours the water out as a drink offering before the Lord as though it were the drink-offering wine of <a title="Leviticus 23 Summary" href="3-9.html#Feasts" target="_blank">Leviticus 23:13 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Warriors"></a>What about these mighty warriors of David? (</b></font><b><font size="4">I Chronicles </font></b><font size="4"><b>12)</b></font><br>

  <p><font size="2">1 Now these were the men who came to David at Ziklag while he was still a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, helpers in the war, <br />
2 armed with bows, using both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows with the bow. They were of Benjamin, Saul&rsquo;s brethren. <br />
3 &para; The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Berachah, and Jehu the Anathothite; <br />
4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite; <br />
5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite; <br />

<p><em>Those fighting men who stood with David as he reigned over Judah alone</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">8 &para; Some Gadites joined David at the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for battle, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as gazelles on the mountains: <br />
9 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, <br />
10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, <br />
11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, <br />
12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, <br />
13 Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh. <br />
14 These were from the sons of Gad, captains of the army; the least was over a hundred, and the greatest was over a thousand. <br />
15 These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west. <br />
16 &para; Then some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold. <br />
17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, &ldquo;If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if to betray me to my enemies, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers look and bring judgment.&rdquo; <br />
18 Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the captains, and he said:<br />
&ldquo;We are yours, O David;<br />
We are on your side, O son of Jesse!<br />
Peace, peace to you,<br />
And peace to your helpers!<br />
For your God helps you.&rdquo; So David received them, and made them captains of the troop. <br />
19 &para; And some from Manasseh defected to David when he was going with the Philistines to battle against Saul; but they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines sent him away by agreement, saying, &ldquo;He may defect to his master Saul and endanger our heads.&rdquo; <br />
20 When he went to Ziklag, those of Manasseh who defected to him were Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of the thousands who were from Manasseh. <br />
21 And they helped David against the bands of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor, and they were captains in the army. <br />
22 For at that time they came to David day by day to help him, until it was a great army, like the army of God. <br />
  </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>Those fighting men who stood with David after the whole Kingdom of Israel was united</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">23 &para; Now these were the numbers of the divisions that were equipped for war, and came to David at Hebron to turn over the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD: <br />
24 of the sons of Judah bearing shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred armed for war; <br />
25 of the sons of Simeon, mighty men of valor fit for war, seven thousand one hundred; <br />
26 of the sons of Levi four thousand six hundred; <br />
27 Jehoiada, the leader of the Aaronites, and with him three thousand seven hundred; <br />
28 Zadok, a young man, a valiant warrior, and from his father&rsquo;s house twenty-two captains; <br />
29 of the sons of Benjamin, relatives of Saul, three thousand (until then the greatest part of them had remained loyal to the house of Saul); <br />
30 of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men throughout their father&rsquo;s house; <br />
31 of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were designated by name to come and make David king; <br />
32 of the sons of Issachar who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their chiefs were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their command; <br />
33 of Zebulun there were fifty thousand who went out to battle, expert in war with all weapons of war, stouthearted men who could keep ranks; <br />
34 of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them thirty-seven thousand with shield and spear; <br />
35 of the Danites who could keep battle formation, twenty-eight thousand six hundred; <br />
36 of Asher, those who could go out to war, able to keep battle formation, forty thousand; <br />
37 of the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, from the other side of the Jordan, one hundred and twenty thousand armed for battle with every kind of weapon of war. <br />
38 &para; All these men of war, who could keep ranks, came to Hebron with a loyal heart, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest of Israel were of one mind to make David king. <br />
39 And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren had prepared for them. <br />
40 Moreover those who were near to them, from as far away as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys and camels, on mules and oxen&mdash;provisions of flour and cakes of figs and cakes of raisins, wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly, for there was joy in Israel. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of those who rode with David prior to his rise over all Israel, the men in verses 1-7 are datable to the 16 months before Saul&#146;s death. Beginning with verse 23 we see the men who came to Hebron after the 7 1/2 years of reign there to turn the whole Kingdom of Israel over to David. Finally, in this chapter, if you're gonna be king, you need a really big army. Well, here's your army - a big ol' army.</p>

		<p>So...David went from his little army consisting of just 6,800 men from Judah to a massive army  of nearly 340,000 almost overnight just prior to taking Jerusalem from the Jebusites. Obviously the Northern Tribes had deviated from God's plan with the inclusion of Levites (Levi, Aaronites and Zadok) in their army. It should be noted that an army of 340,000+ was, and is, an overwhelming force in that region of the world.</p>
