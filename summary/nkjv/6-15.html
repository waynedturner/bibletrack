		<p>With lots of wives, you get lots of children. No, no...this is not all of them by a long shot, but these are born in Jerusalem. We find a list of those born in Hebron along with these also in <a title="I Chronicles 3 Summary" href="4-12.html#Rules" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 17:16-17 (see notes)</a> says of a the future King of Israel, &quot;But he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, for the LORD has said to you, 'You shall not return that way again. Neither shall he multiply wives for himself, lest his heart turn away; nor shall he greatly multiply silver and gold for himself.'&quot; The Hebrew verb for &quot;multiply&quot; means &quot;to create an abundance.&quot; It appears that David had &quot;an abundance&quot; of wives...contrary to the Law of Moses.</p>

<p>For the Philistines, their trouble has just begun with David now as King of Israel; they finally figure out that David is their enemy. Remember back in <a title="I Samuel 29 Summary" href="5-26.html#Achish" target="_blank">I Samuel 29 (see notes)</a> when David was being pursued by Saul? Among whom did he live? The Philistines! But now he's the king of the nation that is their enemy. David seemed to have gotten a honeymoon period while he was just King over Judah, but here they come against David now that he is King over all of Israel. David consults his battle planner, Jehovah (twice in this passage), and soundly defeats the Philistines in northern Judah. In the process of getting trounced by David's army, the Philistines left their idols behind; David and his men burn those idols. Then, on their second battle attempt against David, Jehovah instructs David to come up from behind them - BOOM! Battle over. <b>After those victories, we are told that the nations around Israel feared David and Israel.</b></p>
<p>We notice from II Samuel 5:25 and I Chronicles 14:16 that David's conquest did not include the city of Gezer. Later, the Egyptian Pharaoh conquered Gezer and gave it to Solomon as a dowry for his daughter in <a href="8-10.html#High" title="I Kings 9 Summary" target="_blank">I Kings 9:16 (see notes)</a>, Solomon's first wife on record.</p>

2 And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the Name, the LORD of Hosts, who dwells between the cherubim. <br />
3 So they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart. <br />
4 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, accompanying the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark. <br />
5 Then David and all the house of Israel played music before the LORD on all kinds of instruments of fir wood, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on sistrums, and on cymbals. <br />
6 &para; And when they came to Nachon&rsquo;s threshing floor, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled. <br />
7 Then the anger of the LORD was aroused against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his error; and he died there by the ark of God. <br />
8 And David became angry because of the LORD&rsquo;S outbreak against Uzzah; and he called the name of the place Perez Uzzah to this day. <br />
9 &para; David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said, &ldquo;How can the ark of the LORD come to me?&rdquo; <br />
10 So David would not move the ark of the LORD with him into the City of David; but David took it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. <br />
11 The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months. And the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household. <br />
12 &para; Now it was told King David, saying, &ldquo;The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.&rdquo; So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the City of David with gladness. <br />

3 and let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we have not inquired at it since the days of Saul.&rdquo; <br />
4 Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. <br />
5 &para; So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor in Egypt to as far as the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim. <br />
6 And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, to Kirjath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who dwells between the cherubim, where His name is proclaimed. <br />
7 So they carried the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. <br />
8 Then David and all Israel played music before God with all their might, with singing, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on cymbals, and with trumpets. <br />
9 &para; And when they came to Chidon&rsquo;s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled. <br />

<p><span class="ds1">Let's transport the ark to it's new home in Jerusalem. </span>No...not the big boat - the Ark of the Covenant! It had resided at Shiloh during Eli's day (<a title="I Samuel 4 Summary" href="5-12.html#Hey" target="_blank">I Samuel 5, see notes</a>)? Well, Abinidab, a Levite, has been keeping it in his house since they got it back many years ago. It had been delivered by the Philistines to Abinadab at Kiriath Jearim about eight miles west of Jerusalem on the border between Benjamin and Judah. Saul made no attempt to have the ark returned to its proper home, but David sees the importance and determines to bring it to home...well...sort of home. </p>
<p><b>David wants the ark moved to his new capital city, Jerusalem.</b> The tabernacle built by Moses is actually set up in Gibeon at this point in time. David gets two professional ark movers to do the job, Abinidab's sons Ahio and Uzzah accompanied by 30,000 security guards. Oh, by the way David, there's a God-approved way to move the ark! But these &quot;professionals&quot; decide to haul it on a cart instead - bad mistake! Remember the specific instructions in <a title="Exodus 25 Summary" href="2-20.html#Ark" target="_blank">Exodus 25:12-15 (see notes)</a> regarding the exact procedures for moving the Ark? Well, the high-tech oxen-pulled cart is not in that passage. Leading the way - a big band even includes King David himself. When the cart begins to tip, Uzzah's there to steady it with his hand; he drops dead; that's no way to carry an ark! Discouraged at the incident and afraid of God, David parks the ark with a Levite for further consideration at a later time. That takes the wind out of that sail; David leaves it there at the house of Obededom the Gittite so he can regroup after this tragedy; it stays there for 3 months. Incidentally, the House of Obededom prospers as a result of the presence of the Ark (II Samuel 6:11; I Chronicles 13:14).</p>

3 And David gathered all Israel together at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it. <br />
4 Then David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites: <br />

12 He said to them, &ldquo;You are the heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it. <br />
13 For because you did not do it the first time, the LORD our God broke out against us, because we did not consult Him about the proper order.&rdquo; <br />
14 &para; So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. <br />
15 And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders, by its poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD. <br />
16 &para; Then David spoke to the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers accompanied by instruments of music, stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, by raising the voice with resounding joy. <br />
17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of their brethren, the sons of Merari, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; <br />
18 and with them their brethren of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers; <br />
19 the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound the cymbals of bronze; <br />
20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with strings according to Alamoth; <br />
21 Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, to direct with harps on the Sheminith; <br />
22 Chenaniah, leader of the Levites, was instructor in charge of the music, because he was skillful; <br />
23 Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark; <br />
24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-Edom and Jehiah, doorkeepers for the ark. <br />
25 &para; So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-Edom with joy. <br />
26 And so it was, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bulls and seven rams. <br />
27 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the music master with the singers. David also wore a linen ephod. <br />
28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the horn, with trumpets and with cymbals, making music with stringed instruments and harps. <br />

Afterward, David reclaimed her to be his wife when he was in a position of strength to do so back in <a title="II Samuel 3 Summary" href="5-15.html#Saul" target="_blank">I Samuel 13:8-14 (see notes)</a> that Saul's descendants would have no part of the future throne.</b></p>
<p>We should take particular notice of II Samuel 6:17, &quot;So they brought the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.&quot; <strong>David had built a new tabernacle in Jerusalem for the ark of the covenant.</strong> The other tabernacle is very, very old at this point in time and still resides in Gibeon according to I Chronicles 16:39-40 (<a href="#Celebration">see below</a>). We are not given any details regarding the construction of the new tabernacle. It obviously had an altar where sacrifices could be made as was done on this day.</p>
<p><a name="Celebration"></a><font size="4"><b>Then there's a big ol' the-ark-is-home celebration (I Chronicles 16)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style5">1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it. Then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. <br />
2 And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. <br />
3 Then he distributed to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins. <br />
4 &para; And he appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, to commemorate, to thank, and to praise the LORD God of Israel: <br />
5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obed-Edom: Jeiel with stringed instruments and harps, but Asaph made music with cymbals; <br />
6 Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests regularly blew the trumpets before the ark of the covenant of God. <br />
7 &para; On that day David first delivered this psalm into the hand of Asaph and his brethren, to thank the LORD: <br />
8 	Oh, give thanks to the LORD!<br />
Call upon His name;<br />
Make known His deeds among the peoples! <br />
9 	Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him;<br />
Talk of all His wondrous works! <br />
10 	Glory in His holy name;<br />
Let the hearts of those rejoice who seek the LORD! <br />
11 	Seek the LORD and His strength;<br />
Seek His face evermore! <br />
12 	Remember His marvelous works which He has done,<br />
His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth, <br />
13 	O seed of Israel His servant,<br />
You children of Jacob, His chosen ones! <br />
14 	He is the LORD our God;<br />
His judgments are in all the earth. <br />
15 	Remember His covenant forever,<br />
The word which He commanded, for a thousand generations, <br />
16 	The covenant which He made with Abraham,<br />
And His oath to Isaac, <br />
17 	And confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,<br />
To Israel for an everlasting covenant, <br />
18 	Saying, &ldquo;To you I will give the land of Canaan<br />
As the allotment of your inheritance,&rdquo; <br />
19 	When you were few in number,<br />
Indeed very few, and strangers in it. <br />
20 	When they went from one nation to another,<br />
And from one kingdom to another people, <br />
21 	He permitted no man to do them wrong;<br />
Yes, He rebuked kings for their sakes, <br />
22 	Saying, &ldquo;Do not touch My anointed ones,<br />
And do My prophets no harm.&rdquo; <br />
23 	Sing to the LORD, all the earth;<br />
Proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day. <br />
24 	Declare His glory among the nations,<br />
His wonders among all peoples. <br />
25 	For the LORD is great and greatly to be praised;<br />
He is also to be feared above all gods. <br />
26 	For all the gods of the peoples are idols,<br />
But the LORD made the heavens. <br />
27 	Honor and majesty are before Him;<br />
Strength and gladness are in His place. <br />
28 	Give to the LORD, O families of the peoples,<br />
Give to the LORD glory and strength. <br />
29 	Give to the LORD the glory due His name;<br />
Bring an offering, and come before Him.<br />
Oh, worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness! <br />
30 	Tremble before Him, all the earth.<br />
The world also is firmly established,<br />
It shall not be moved. <br />
31 	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;<br />
And let them say among the nations, &ldquo;The LORD reigns.&rdquo; <br />
32 	Let the sea roar, and all its fullness;<br />
Let the field rejoice, and all that is in it. <br />
33 	Then the trees of the woods shall rejoice before the LORD,<br />
For He is coming to judge the earth. <br />
34 	Oh, give thanks to the LORD, for He is good!<br />
For His mercy endures forever. <br />
35 	And say, &ldquo;Save us, O God of our salvation;<br />
Gather us together, and deliver us from the Gentiles,<br />
To give thanks to Your holy name,<br />
To triumph in Your praise.&rdquo; <br />
36 	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel<br />
From everlasting to everlasting! And all the people said, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; and praised the LORD. <br />
37 &para; So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister before the ark regularly, as every day&rsquo;s work required; <br />
38 and Obed-Edom with his sixty-eight brethren, including Obed-Edom the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah, to be gatekeepers; <br />
39 and Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place that was at Gibeon, <br />
40 to offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the Law of the LORD which He commanded Israel; <br />
41 and with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because His mercy endures forever; <br />
42 and with them Heman and Jeduthun, to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals and the musical instruments of God. Now the sons of Jeduthun were gatekeepers. <br />
43 &para; Then all the people departed, every man to his house; and David returned to bless his house. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the ark gets a home. When the job's done, David distributes food - a full meal to everyone. Then, the big song of thanksgiving - sung by his newly-formed men's ensemble headed up by Asaph. The song begins in verse 8 and ends in verse 36 with, &quot;Blessed be the LORD God of Israel From everlasting to everlasting! And all the people said, 'Amen!' and praised the LORD.&quot; It's a song that recounts the covenant between God and Israel and invokes the names of Abraham and Jacob in the lyrics. The album goes super platinum - still being played today. Of course...when the king writes a song and has it sung by special singers before the people, what else are the song critics going to say? Job complete! The ark's now in Jerusalem!</p>
<p>It should be noted that verses 39-40 clearly indicate that the tabernacle is now residing in Gibeon. Since the ark had been removed from the tabernacle back in Eli's day (<a title="I Samuel 4 Summary" href="5-12.html#Plan" target="_blank">I Samuel 4, see notes</a>), it had never been returned there. And now...it's still not to be returned to the tabernacle, but instead resides in a special place in Jerusalem prepared by King David.</p>
