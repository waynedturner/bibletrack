<p><font size="3">This is <strong>a continuation by John of the sixth trial of Jesus</strong> leading up to his crucifixion, and this is his second appearance before Pilate. This trial began back in <a href="6-14.html#Herod" title="Luke 23 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 23:6-16 (see notes)</a>; neither do Matthew nor Mark.</font> That being the case, when one just reads the accounts of Matthew, Mark and John, one is left with the impression that Jesus only appeared before Pilate once, and that this is a continuation of trial #4. However, Luke puts it into perspective in letting us know that this is the second appearance of Jesus before Pilate. This incident takes place after Jesus has been scourged, mocked with the crown of thorns and tortured by the Roman guards. </p>
<p>You can imagine that Jesus' physical appearance at this point in time must have been distasteful to view. It would appear that Pilate is thinking that the Jewish leadership will look upon Jesus in this condition and say &quot;enough is enough!&quot; Nope! <b>They want him crucified.</b> Pilate then tries to pass the responsibility off to them, but they pull out the big guns in verse 7 when they proclaim, &quot;We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.&quot; The Jewish leaders are undoubtedly invoking <a href="3-11.html#Death" title="Leviticus 24 Summary" target="_blank">Leviticus 24:16 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him, the stranger as well as him who is born in the land. When he blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall be put to death.&quot;  </p>
<p>Here's a personal observation with my informed opinion regarding the circumstances and tactics of these angry Jewish leaders. At this point in Jesus' earthly ministry, many of the everyday Jews were losing respect for the corrupt Jewish leadership and giving heed to the teachings of Jesus. Because of this large-scale popularity among the Jewish populace, the Jewish leadership had devised a way to find and capture Jesus at night when the people would not see their anti-Jesus actions. Judas provided the betrayal they needed and allowed them to capture Jesus in an obscure spot in the garden way after nightfall when the multitudes had bedded down for the night. All of the six trials had taken place in the wee hours of the morning while regular ol' Jews were sleeping. Here's the plan: <b>When these regular people wake up, they need to see Jesus being put to death by Romans, not by the Jewish leadership.</b> The Roman judgment hall is packed with anti-Jesus Jewish leaders - not common Jews. To the typical common Jew, Jesus was popular among the people when he went to bed and being crucified by the Roman government when he woke up; <b>what a full night that had been!</b> Undoubtedly, the Jewish leadership felt that if the entire process involving their sinister actions can take place during the night, they will be held guiltless by the Jewish people. By the next morning, it looks like a Roman campaign to put a stop to Jesus. I'm relatively certain that most of the Jewish population had no idea that this whole crucifixion had been orchestrated by their very own Jewish leaders.</p>
		<p><b>Pilate's job was to keep peace in his territory. Now his judgment hall is filled with Jews crying for the immediate execution of Jesus; Pilate senses his dilemma.</b> Jesus actually comforts Pilate at that point in verse 11 when he tells Pilate, &quot;You could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore<b> the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.&quot;</b> Subsequently, Pilate wants to release Jesus, but notice verse 12, <b>&quot;From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, &ldquo;If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar&rsquo;s friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.&quot;</b> The Jewish leadership is so determined to have Jesus crucified, they make an unimaginable statement in verse 15, &quot;The chief priests answered, &ldquo;We have no king but Caesar!&quot; They lived their lives looking forward to the overthrow of the Roman government, but make a proclamation like this for their own wicked self interests.</p>
	<p>John reports in John 19:14 that this proceeding took place &quot;about the sixth hour.&quot; John is apparently the only Gospel writer to render the time using the Roman convention for doing so. Mark reports in Mark 15:25, &quot;Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.&quot; That means three hours from the beginning of the day (sunrise), or about 9:00 a.m. or so. The abbreviation a.m. represents a latin phrase &quot;ante meridiem&quot; which means &quot;before noon.&quot; That usage began in Rome during the fourth century B.C. and originally counted backwards from when the sun reached it's highest point during the day. So, when John reports &quot;about the sixth hour,&quot; he is referring to six hours before the sun reached its highest point, placing it in the 6:00 a.m. range for this trial, perhaps a little later by our clocks since John uses the preposition &quot;about.&quot;</p>

<p>Jesus bears his own cross as they head to the place of crucifixion. However, along the way a man is solicited to assist him named Simon, who was from Cyrene. Only Luke records Jesus speaking to the women who were following along when he prophesies of the coming persecution. In less than 40 years after the crucifixion, Jerusalem would undergo a massive assault by the Roman army. Josephus (War of the Jews, Book 6, chapter 3) reports that some mothers were reduced to eating their children during the famine in Rome&#146;s siege against Jerusalem, A.D. 66-70. You will recall that Jesus had already prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem back in <a title="Matthew 24, Luke 21 Summaries" href="5-17.html#Question" target="_blank">Matthew 24:2 and Luke 21:6 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p>Jesus draws from the words of <a href="9-27.html#Say" title="Hosea 10 Summary" target="_blank">Hosea 10:8 (see notes)</a> in Luke 23:30 when he quotes, &quot;<font size="3">Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'&quot;</font> Jesus is likely making reference to the coming destruction of Jerusalem with these words.</p>

<p>When they parted the garment of Jesus and cast lots for it, all four gospel writers record it, but only <b>Matthew and John relate the action to a fulfillment of the Messianic prophecy by David</b> in <a title="Psalm 22 Summary" href="10-7.html#Isaiah" target="_blank">Isaiah 53:12 (see notes)</a>, &quot;...And He was numbered with the transgressors, 	And He bore the sin of many, 	And made intercession for the transgressors.&quot; That was a reference to Jesus being crucified with criminals. However, Luke records that one of those criminals trusts Jesus for salvation and is received by Jesus that day (Luke 23:43). All four Gospels record the sign placed upon the cross of Jesus that read, <b>&quot;THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.&quot;</b> It was written in three languages - Hebrew, Greek and Latin. Only John records how much this irritated the Jewish leadership. They wanted it reworded, but Pilate refused.</p>
<p><b>You will notice that the Jewish leadership persists in their ridicule of Jesus even as he is hanging on the cross.</b> Why? It is important to them to dispel any belief among the common Jewish masses that Jesus is the Messiah. Therefore, they make a point to note that Jesus, who performed many miracles during his earthly ministry, is not delivering himself from this cruel death. <b>To them, this taunting should prove to the masses that Jesus is not the Messiah.</b></p>

Jesus, however, assigns the responsibility of his mother's welfare to &quot;the disciple whom Jesus loved.&quot; Most scholars agree that this is a reference to John. The other two Marys at the cross were Mary Magdalene and Mary, the wife of Cleopas (aka Alphaeus) and mother of James, one of the twelve Apostles. She was Mary's sister according to verse 25. Two sisters named Mary...must indicate the popularity of the name &quot;Mary.&quot;</font> As a matter of fact, archaeologists have speculated from the inscriptions on ossuaries that approximately 25% of all women during that period were named &quot;Mary.&quot;</p>
