The valleys also are covered with grain;<br>
They shout for joy, they also sing. <br>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a Psalm that recounts the blessings of God. David writes this one, and he makes particular reference to the blessings of God on Zion (Jerusalem). Getting a fix on the exact period of this writing is difficult. David's reference to the &quot;temple&quot; in verse 4 would indicate that, at the very least, David was anticipating the building of the temple in Jerusalem at the time of this writing. David lists the great blessings  and works of God.</p>
<p>Verse 3 is particularly noteworthy: &quot;Iniquities prevail against me; As for our transgressions, You will provide atonement for them.&quot; David acknowledges the remedy for sin - then and now; it is purged away by God himself. For us, that's <a href="12-3.html#Purpose" title="I John 1 Summary" target="_blank">I John 1:9 (see notes)</a>, &quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Awesome"></a>How awesome are your deeds (Psalm 66)<br>

&ldquo;How awesome are Your works!<br>

7 	He rules by His power forever;<br>

I will offer bulls with goats.<br>

He has attended to the voice of my prayer. <br>
20 	Blessed be God,<br>
Who has not turned away my prayer,<br>
Nor His mercy from me! <br>
  </font></p>

<p>This unknown author expresses that, while God has allowed him to go through trial, he answers his prayers for deliverance and blessing. Look at verse 18, &quot;If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear.&quot; The author understood that harbored sin interfered with his fellowship with God.</p>
<p><b>A brief overview of this Psalm is:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>A call on all the earth to praise God (verses 1-12)
			<li>The author offers sacrifice and praise (verses 13-15)
			<li>The author exhorts the people to prayer and praise (verses 16-20). 
        </ul>
        <p>Incidentally, the multiple occurrences of the transliterated Hebrew word &quot;Selah&quot; here  are unusual. While the word of unknown meaning is used 72 times in Psalms and two times in Habakkuk, it is usually found once at the end of a Psalm. Here it is used three times. Perhaps the word meant &quot;rest,&quot; having something to do with the presentation of the song itself.</p>

<p><font size="3">We aren't given the authorship of this Psalm, but it seems to fit into the same group as Psalm 66. The multiple occurrences of the transliterated Hebrew word &quot;Selah&quot; here  are unusual, used twice here and three times in Psalm 66 (<a href="#Awesome">see above</a>). With regard to the subtitle, The subtitle says, &quot;To the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments.&quot; That refers to the leader of that part of the temple choir which played on stringed instruments. </font>Let the people praise God. I can picture the people singing this one in the fields as they harvest their crops.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">To the Chief Musician. Set to &ldquo;The Lilies.&rdquo; A Psalm of David. <br>
    1 &para; 	Save me, O God!<br>
For the waters have come up to my neck. <br>
2 	I sink in deep mire,<br>
Where there is no standing;<br>
I have come into deep waters,<br>
Where the floods overflow me. <br>
3 	I am weary with my crying;<br>
My throat is dry;<br>
My eyes fail while I wait for my God. <br>
4 	Those who hate me without a cause<br>
Are more than the hairs of my head;<br>
They are mighty who would destroy me,<br>
Being my enemies wrongfully;<br>
Though I have stolen nothing,<br>
I still must restore it.<br>
5 	O God, You know my foolishness;<br>
And my sins are not hidden from You. <br>
6 	Let not those who wait for You, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed because of me;<br>
Let not those who seek You be confounded because of me, O God of Israel. <br>
7 	Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;<br>
Shame has covered my face. <br>
8 	I have become a stranger to my brothers,<br>
And an alien to my mother&rsquo;s children; <br>
9 	Because zeal for Your house has eaten me up,<br>
And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me. <br>
10 	When I wept and chastened my soul with fasting,<br>
That became my reproach. <br>
11 	I also made sackcloth my garment;<br>
I became a byword to them. <br>
12 	Those who sit in the gate speak against me,<br>
And I am the song of the drunkards. <br>
13 	But as for me, my prayer is to You,<br>
O LORD, in the acceptable time;<br>
O God, in the multitude of Your mercy,<br>
Hear me in the truth of Your salvation. <br>
14 	Deliver me out of the mire,<br>
And let me not sink;<br>
Let me be delivered from those who hate me,<br>
And out of the deep waters. <br>
15 	Let not the floodwater overflow me,<br>
Nor let the deep swallow me up;<br>
And let not the pit shut its mouth on me. <br>
16 	Hear me, O LORD, for Your lovingkindness is good;<br>
Turn to me according to the multitude of Your tender mercies. <br>
17 	And do not hide Your face from Your servant,<br>
For I am in trouble;<br>
Hear me speedily. <br>
18 	Draw near to my soul, and redeem it;<br>
Deliver me because of my enemies. <br>
19 	You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor;<br>
My adversaries are all before You. <br>
20 	Reproach has broken my heart,<br>
And I am full of heaviness;<br>
I looked for someone to take pity, but there was none;<br>
And for comforters, but I found none. <br>
21 	They also gave me gall for my food,<br>
And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. <br>
22 	Let their table become a snare before them,<br>
And their well-being a trap. <br>
23 	Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see;<br>
And make their loins shake continually. <br>
24 	Pour out Your indignation upon them,<br>
And let Your wrathful anger take hold of them. <br>
25 	Let their dwelling place be desolate;<br>
Let no one live in their tents. <br>
26 	For they persecute the ones You have struck,<br>
And talk of the grief of those You have wounded. <br>
27 	Add iniquity to their iniquity,<br>
And let them not come into Your righteousness. <br>
28 	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,<br>
And not be written with the righteous. <br>
29 	But I am poor and sorrowful;<br>
Let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high. <br>
30 	I will praise the name of God with a song,<br>
And will magnify Him with thanksgiving. <br>
31 	This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bull,<br>
Which has horns and hooves. <br>
32 	The humble shall see this and be glad;<br>
And you who seek God, your hearts shall live. <br>
33 	For the LORD hears the poor,<br>
And does not despise His prisoners. <br>
34 	Let heaven and earth praise Him,<br>
The seas and everything that moves in them. <br>
35 	For God will save Zion<br>
And build the cities of Judah,<br>
That they may dwell there and possess it. <br>
36 	Also, the descendants of His servants shall inherit it,<br>
And those who love His name shall dwell in it. <br>

<p><font size="3">David is identified as the author here in the introduction. </font></p>
<p><b>Note what is written regarding this Psalm in the Expositor's Bible Commentary: </b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Because of the many references to it in the NT, this psalm has been interpreted messianically. The messianic interpretation is in the form of an application to the life of devotion to God by the Lord Jesus Christ. The primary significance is David and his suffering. He calls on the Lord to deliver him (vv.1-21) for the sake of &#147;those who hope in you&#148; (v.6). Moreover, he prays for the fall of the wicked (vv.22-29). The lament changes to a hymn of thanksgiving in anticipation of God&#146;s redemption (vv.29-36).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><b>So, what about it? Is this Psalm messianic prophecy or not? Let's look at some of the wording in Psalms 69 and see how it was quoted in the New Testament.</b></p>

			  </td>
		  </tr>
		</table>
		<p>T<b>here's no question that Psalm 69:4 and 9 were definitely held by John, Paul and the rest of the disciples to be references to the Messiah.</b></p>
	<p>While not specifically mentioned in <a title="Matthew 27:48, Mark 15:36, John 19:29-30 Summary" href="6-23.html#Darkness" target="_blank">Matthew 27:48, Mark 15:36, John 19:29-30 (see notes)</a> the vinegar given to Jesus seconds before his death on the cross seems to fit nicely with the prophetic words of Psalm 69:21, &quot;They also gave me gall for my food, And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.&quot;</p>
	<p>Interestingly enough, Peter makes use of verse 25 when he quotes it as justification for replacing Judas in <a href="7-4.html" title="Acts 1 Summary" target="_blank">Acts 1:20 (see notes)</a>. It is obvious, therefore, that Peter held Judas wholly culpable for the deeds he had done by the Jewish leaders and Romans at the crucifixion. Peter's interest there seems to be to eradicate any influence Judas had in the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ.</p>
