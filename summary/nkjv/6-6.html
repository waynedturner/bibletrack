<p>Jesus heads from the supper to the Garden of Gethsemane. You will notice from John 18:1 that <b>this is not the same occasion where Jesus prayed in </b><a title="John 17 Summary" href="6-2.html#Prayer" target="_blank"><b>John 17</b> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> All the disciples went to the garden, but Matthew and Mark report that Jesus only took three of them (Peter, James and John) closer to the place in the garden where he prayed. It is worth noting that these disciples could not remain awake while Jesus prayed. These are disciples who, just a few hours earlier, had proclaimed that they would be willing to die for Jesus if necessary (<a title="Matthew 26 Summary" href="5-29.html#Denial" target="_blank">Matthew 26:31-35; Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34; John 13:36-38 - see notes</a>). Yeah! But <b>can you stay awake for Jesus!</b> </p>
<p>I think there's a lesson here. <b>The test of discipleship is, first of all, obeying and following Jesus in the small things first. </b>Matthew, Mark and Luke record the same comment by Jesus when he implies that the temptation to betrayal can be offset by prayer - not sleeping. Many Believers today are quick to declare the sacrifice that they are willing to make for the sake of Christ. Here's the question: Are you making the little sacrifices that demonstrate your love for Jesus Christ right now? Peter, James and John were admonished three times to &quot;watch and pray,&quot; but they failed to do so. Is it any surprise, therefore, that they were also unwilling to stand with Jesus during his trials later on that night?</p>
<p><b>If Jesus is God (and he is), why is he praying? </b>The answer is to be found in <a title="Philippians 2 Summary" href="10-12.html#Emulate" target="_blank">Philippians 2:7-8 (see notes)</a>, &quot;but [Jesus] made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.&quot; At this point in time, Jesus had emptied himself of his attributes of deity; he communicated with God in Heaven just as we do.<b> The subject of the prayer: Is there a way to redeem the world without dying on the cross? NO! </b>It's an intense prayer - to the point that Luke (the physician) records, &quot;His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.&quot; Luke's reference to blood here must mean that the sweat dripping from Jesus was in such quantity that it was similar to blood dripping from a wound. Yet, the disciples slept through the whole ordeal.</p>
<p>A couple of more observations are interesting here. John gives no detail regarding the prayer activities in Gethsemane. In fact, he was one of the sleepers in the garden; perhaps he did not witness very much there. Luke, on the other hand, is the only one to report that an angel came and ministered to Jesus there during his prayer. Luke received his eyewitness account from one or more of the disciples at a later date. Apparently all of the disciples could see Jesus praying, inasmuch as Luke reports that they were only a &quot;stone's throw&quot; away. Peter, James and John were closer.</p>
<p>By the way, we have seen Jesus gather these three disciples together for special events before. A year or so earlier, when Jesus went to the house of Jairus to resurrect his daughter (<a href="2-26.html#Resurrection" title="Matthew 9; Mark 5; Luke 8 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 9:18-26; Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56 - see notes</a>), he only allowed these three of his disciples to accompany him into the house. Then again, at the Transfiguration (<a href="3-18.html#Transfiguration" title="Matthew 17; Mark 9; Luke 9 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 17:1-9; Mark 9:2-10; Luke 9:28-36 - see notes</a>), only these three of Jesus' disciples were allowed to witness that miracle. It's obvious that these three men had been selected for Jesus' leadership team among the disciples.</p>

		<p>John identifies the crowd in 18:3, &quot;Then Judas, having received a detachment of troops, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.&quot; <b>We see in John 18:2 that Judas anticipated that Jesus would go there because he had done so on previous occasions. You will recall from </b><a title="Luke 22:3-6 Summary" href="5-25.html#Judas" target="_blank"><b>Luke 22:3-6</b> (see notes)</a><b> that the agreement with Judas was that he take them to Jesus in a spot away from the multitudes so that they could take him without the notice of the common people.</b> This isolated location in the garden was that opportunity.</p>
	<p>Quite a crowd shows up to capture Jesus. John records, &quot;a detachment of troops, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.&quot; This angry crowd is taking no chances. <b>Judas does the betraying, but John records that Jesus freely and openly acknowledges that he is the one for whom they are looking.</b> John records that Jesus shields the other disciples from danger in verses 8-9. He notes that Jesus did so in order to fulfill his own previous words found in <a href="6-2.html#Now" title="John 17 Summary" target="_blank">John 17:12 (see notes)</a> when he prayed, &quot;While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. Those whom You gave Me I have kept; and none of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.&quot; Both Matthew and Mark report that Judas addresses Jesus as &quot;Rabbi&quot; (Greek: rabbi). This was a general title of respect and honor frequently used to acknowledge a person's accomplishments in interpreting the Jewish Scriptures. Matthew records in verse 50 that Jesus addresses Judas when he says, &quot;Friend, why have you come?&quot; The &quot;friend&quot; that is used to characterize Jesus' reference to Judas here is not the usual &quot;philos&quot; used for friend indicating affection between two people. Instead, Jesus refers to Judas as &quot;hetairos,&quot; which simply means &quot;comrade&quot; or &quot;associate.&quot; </p>
	<p>We should observe that, while all of the disciples of Jesus did flee from Jesus that night, Jesus did encourage them to do so in John 18:8, &quot;Jesus answered, &ldquo;I have told you that I am He. Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way,&quot;</p>

		<p>Judas does the betrayal deed, but Peter takes his sword and lops off the ear of the high priest's servant, Malchus (John 18:10). Jesus returns the ear to its place and declares that his betrayal and capture are part of the divine plan. It's curious that only John records the actual name of the ear lopper. </p>
		<p>Matthew 26:56 is an eye opener regarding Jesus' disciples - the ones who had earlier proclaimed that they would die for Jesus - when it says,<b> &quot;Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.&quot; </b>Mark says the same in verse 50. It's just most interesting to note that Matthew makes reference to himself (he was one of those disciples) when he records these words in verse 56.</p>
	<p>Jesus points out to the angry mob (&quot;with swords and clubs&quot;) how unnecessary it is for them to take him with this (seemingly) overwhelming force. Only Matthew makes a point to link Jesus' passive surrender to Old Testament prophecy when he says in verse 56, &quot;But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&quot;<b> David, Isaiah and others had recorded prophecies concerning the suffering Messiah; there was no other way.</b></p>
	<p>We should take notice of the fact that Peter was willing to fight to the death with Jesus; the sword/ear incident demonstrates that. Peter wasn't, however, prepared to passively stand there and surrender. Add to that the fact that Jesus requests that his disciples be allowed to leave without harm in  John 18:8 (<a href="#Crowd">see above</a>), and you can see why Peter's denial at this point wasn't such a glaring incident. However, later that night when Jesus was on trial before Annas and Caiaphas (<a href="6-10.html#Trial" title="Matthew 26; Mark 14; Luke 22; John 18 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 26:57-75; Mark 14:53-72; Luke 22:54-65; John 18:13-27 - see notes</a>), Peter does make his infamous denial of Jesus that has caused him to be set apart from the other disciples.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, &quot;certain young man&quot; of Mark 14:51-52 is only found in those two verses. Why did Mark only include this incident without explanation? Many have conjectured that Mark is referring to himself there; really, there's no way of knowing for certain.</p>
