    <p><font size="4"><b>Meanwhile...back to the genealogies...<br>
				</b></font><font size="3">It's quite important to understand the purpose of Chronicles. The exiles began leaving Judah in 605 B.C. When the exiles returned to their land after 535 B.C., the author of Chronicles sought to give the returning exiles a perspective on their history and heritage. He therefore summed up and restated the essentials of the historical books that had preceded them. Isn't it interesting that Jews in the first century A.D. could trace their ancestors back four thousand years, while I can only trace mine back 250 years?</font></p>

  <p><font size="2">1 So all Israel was recorded by genealogies, and indeed, they were inscribed in the book of the kings of Israel. But Judah was carried away captive to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness. <br />
2 And the first inhabitants who dwelt in their possessions in their cities were Israelites, priests, Levites, and the Nethinim. <br />
3 &para; Now in Jerusalem the children of Judah dwelt, and some of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh: <br />
4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the descendants of Perez, the son of Judah. <br />
5 Of the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn and his sons. <br />
6 Of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel, and their brethren&mdash;six hundred and ninety. <br />
7 Of the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah; <br />
8 Ibneiah the son of Jeroham; Elah the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri; Meshullam the son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah; <br />
9 and their brethren, according to their generations&mdash;nine hundred and fifty-six. All these men were heads of a father&rsquo;s house in their fathers&rsquo; houses. <br />
10 &para; Of the priests: Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, and Jachin; <br />
11 Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the officer over the house of God; <br />
12 Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah; Maasai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer; <br />
13 and their brethren, heads of their fathers&rsquo; houses&mdash;one thousand seven hundred and sixty. They were very able men for the work of the service of the house of God. <br />
14 &para; Of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari; <br />
15 Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph; <br />
16 Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the Netophathites. <br />
17 &para; And the gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brethren. Shallum was the chief. <br />
18 Until then they had been gatekeepers for the camps of the children of Levi at the King&rsquo;s Gate on the east. <br />
19 &para; Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, from his father&rsquo;s house, the Korahites, were in charge of the work of the service, gatekeepers of the tabernacle. Their fathers had been keepers of the entrance to the camp of the LORD. <br />
20 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar had been the officer over them in time past; the LORD was with him. <br />
21 Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was keeper of the door of the tabernacle of meeting. <br />
22 &para; All those chosen as gatekeepers were two hundred and twelve. They were recorded by their genealogy, in their villages. David and Samuel the seer had appointed them to their trusted office. <br />
23 So they and their children were in charge of the gates of the house of the LORD, the house of the tabernacle, by assignment. <br />
24 The gatekeepers were assigned to the four directions: the east, west, north, and south. <br />
25 And their brethren in their villages had to come with them from time to time for seven days. <br />
26 For in this trusted office were four chief gatekeepers; they were Levites. And they had charge over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. <br />
27 And they lodged all around the house of God because they had the responsibility, and they were in charge of opening it every morning. <br />
28 &para; Now some of them were in charge of the serving vessels, for they brought them in and took them out by count. <br />
29 Some of them were appointed over the furnishings and over all the implements of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour and the wine and the oil and the incense and the spices. <br />
30 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices. <br />
31 &para; Mattithiah of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the trusted office over the things that were baked in the pans. <br />
32 And some of their brethren of the sons of the Kohathites were in charge of preparing the showbread for every Sabbath. <br />
33 &para; These are the singers, heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of the Levites, who lodged in the chambers, and were free from other duties; for they were employed in that work day and night. <br />
34 These heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of the Levites were heads throughout their generations. They dwelt at Jerusalem. <br />

You will notice that the list contains many Levites; since the temple was located there, a heavy concentration of Levites dwelled near the temple. Verse 34 sums up the Levitical inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>These verses reproduce the lines of Benjamin living near Jerusalem (verse 38). It basically repeats 8:29-38 (<a href="#Genealogy">see above</a>) on the family of Saul; but its purpose here is to introduce the tragic end to his reign found in chapter 10.</p>
<p><a name="Review"></a><font size="4"><b>Now for a review on Saul's death (I Chronicles 10)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="2">1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. <br />
2 Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul&rsquo;s sons. <br />
3 The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers. <br />
4 Then Saul said to his armorbearer, &ldquo;Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and abuse me.&rdquo; But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it. <br />
5 And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died. <br />
6 So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together. <br />
7 And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; then the Philistines came and dwelt in them. <br />
8 &para; So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. <br />
9 And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among the people. <br />
10 Then they put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. <br />
11 &para; And when all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, <br />
12 all the valiant men arose and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons; and they brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. <br />
13 &para; So Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he had committed against the LORD, because he did not keep the word of the LORD, and also because he consulted a medium for guidance. <br />
14 But he did not inquire of the LORD; therefore He killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse. </font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a repeat of the story found in <a title="I Samuel 31 Summary" href="5-26.html#Saul" target="_blank">I Samuel 31 (see notes)</a> regarding the death of Saul. The rest of I Chronicles deals entirely with the reign of David down to his death in the last chapter of I Chronicles. Sometimes life isn't fair - they both reigned 40 years, but David gets 19 chapters while Saul gets 1. Not only so, Saul's chapter just deals with his death.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, however, that <b>the reason for the termination of the throne of Saul is found in verses 13-14 here</b>, &quot;So Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he had committed against the LORD, because he did not keep the word of the LORD, and also because he consulted a medium for guidance.  But he did not inquire of the LORD; therefore He killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.&quot; So, Saul's kingdom was terminated because of his disobedience to God in <a title="I Samuel 15 Summary" href="5-26.html#Witch" target="_blank">I Samuel 28, see notes)</a></p>
	<p>Interestingly enough, the incident of <a title="I Samuel 13 Summary" href="5-15.html#Saul" target="_blank">I Samuel 13:8-14 (see notes)</a> is not mentioned per se. Note I Samuel 13:13-14, &quot;And Samuel said to Saul, &ldquo;You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which He commanded you. For now the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. But now your kingdom shall not continue. The LORD has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be commander over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.&quot; Upon close inspection of Samuel's words here, the punishment for disobedience seems to be that Saul's kingdom will not continue through his descendants. Had it been that Saul had practiced obedience to the Lord as David did, Jews today would be looking for the establishment of the throne of Saul rather than the throne of David.</p>
