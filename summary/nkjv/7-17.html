	<p>We
	  don't know who wrote this Psalm, but it seems to be the same author who
	  wrote this and Psalm 112. It opens and closes with a call to praise
	  God. Verse 5 says, "...He will ever be mindful of His covenant." He
	  says again in verse 9, "He has sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever:" It's not clear to which covenant he
	  refers, but it is likely the covenant God made with Abraham that is in
	  view here (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Abrahamic_Covenant.html" title="Abrahamic Covenant" target="_blank">see Abrahamic Covenant</a>). One thing is for certain; <b>the Psalmist knows the value of a covenant with God.<br>
      </b></p>
	<p>Except for the introduction, "Praise the LORD," this is an
acrostic Psalm. Each verse has two or three phrases - each beginning
with the next successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. This was an
oft-used poetic writing style in Hebrew.<b><br>

    </blockquote>
	<p>Probably
		  written by the same author as Psalm 111, here's a comparison
		  between the righteous and the wicked. It's also written in an acrostic poetry style (see notes on Psalm 111, above). We see in verse 1 the primary
		  characteristic of the righteous, "Praise the LORD! Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, Who delights greatly in His commandments." In the last verse (10) we see the consequence of the
		  wicked, "The wicked will see it and be grieved; He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked shall perish."</p>
	<p>In making his appeal about being generous in giving of one's resources, Paul quotes most of verse 9 in <a href="9-18.html#Key" title="II Corinthians 9 Summary" target="_blank">II Corinthians 9:9 (see notes)</a>, &quot;As it is written: 	&ldquo;He has dispersed abroad, 	He has given to the poor; 	His righteousness endures forever.&quot;</p>

</b></font> We are told that Psalms 113-118 were sung before and after
the passover feast each year - 113 and 114 before the meal and the
remaining four afterward. <a href="5-25.html#Supper" title="Mark 14 Summary" target="_blank">Mark 14:26 (see notes)</a> says, "And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives." This hymn that Jesus and
his disciples sang just prior to his crucifixion was likely taken from
Psalms 113-118. <strong>The identity of the author of these six Psalms is not
known.</strong><br>

<p>The author here is unknown. He points out that the
  relationship we have with God is our greatest asset. Look at the way he
  starts this Psalm, "I love the LORD, because He has heard My voice and my supplications." It's a father-child relationship where God is intent
  on meeting our needs. Notice the confidence of the Psalmist in his
  eternal destiny with the Lord in verse 15, "Precious in the sight of the LORD Is the death of His saints."</p>
<p>Incidentally, Paul quotes verse 10 in <a href="9-14.html#Instruments" title="II Corinthians 4 Summary" target="_blank">II Corinthians 4:13 (see notes)</a> to make the point that he is speaking by the same Spirit as this Psalmist.</p>

This Psalm is short, but the theme is long; God is eternal. Notice what he says about truth in verse 2, &quot;the truth of the LORD endures forever.&quot; Truth is a constant; it does not change. </p>

<p title="Acts 4 Summary">Although the author is unknown, here's
  a very quotable Psalm. Verse 8 says, "It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in man." You gotta love that verse. This Psalm
  becomes very notable because of verse 22, "The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone." That's the verse Peter
  quoted in <a href="7-8.html#Sanhedrin" target="_blank">Acts 4:11 (see notes</a><a title="Acts 4 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=07&amp;dy=08" target="_blank">)</a>. However, notice that it is used in a prophetic context in <a title="Isaiah 28 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=28#Justice" target="_blank">Isaiah 28:16 (see notes)</a>,
  "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: 	&ldquo;Behold, I lay in Zion a stone for a foundation, 	A tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; 	Whoever believes will not act hastily." Jesus is the
  cornerstone who was rejected. This verse is also used by Jesus himself
  in a parable to the Jewish leaders regarding his imminent crucifixion
  in <a title="Matthew 21:42/Mark 12:10/Luke 20:17 Summary" href="11-25.html#Who" target="_blank">I Peter 2:6 (see notes)</a>. </p>
<p>Jesus also quotes verse 26 in <a href="5-13.html#Woe" title="Matthew 23 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 23:39 (see notes)</a>. In that passage, Jesus proclaims with that quote that the Messianic requirement will be fulfilled after his resurrection.</p>
