	<p><font size="4"><b>An introduction to Acts<br>
</b></font><font size="3">Acts
  was written by Luke as a continuation of his gospel. While addressed to
  an unknown Christian named Theophilus, it is a history of the early
  church after the ascension of Jesus. <b><font color="#FF0000">The Book of Acts is inspired by the Holy Spirit to be an accurate account of the activities of the early church.</font></b> The question is: Can it be regarded as more than that? I mean, <b>to what extent should we adopt the Book of Acts as a doctrinal book?</b> In other words,<b>
  are the words and events found in Acts to be heeded and emulated as
  absolute doctrine without further validation from the epistles of the
  New Testament?</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="3">To answer that question, let's analyze it in the
  light of what we understand about Old Testament scripture. For example,
  II Samuel is a God-inspired account of David's life. However, it is not
  an endorsement of all David's activities as those that should be
  emulated...or even necessarily respected. We understand that II Samuel
  is an accurate account of a man, David, of whom it is said in <a href="8-20.html#Hard" title="I Kings 14 Summary" target="_blank">I Kings
  14:8 (see notes)</a>, "...who followed Me [God] with all his heart." What about the
  central characters of the Book of Acts? <b>Can we assume that each
    action by James, Peter, Paul and the other Apostles was infallible just
    because it was recorded in the Book of Acts?</b> We don't assume that
  about David in II Samuel, but we do acknowledge that the inspiration of
  scripture guarantees that it is an accurate record of David's actions -
  good or bad. That has to be the case with the Book of Acts also. </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>The characters in the Book of Acts were fallible men who were continuing the ministry commissioned by Jesus himself.</b> Not everything they did and said, as recorded in the Book of Acts, is
  necessarily to be adopted as doctrinal practice any more than
  everything David did and said is to be so regarded. As a matter of
  fact, Paul speaks of Peter in <a title="Galatians 2 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=26#Dispute" target="_blank">Galatians 2:11 (see notes)</a>,
  "Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed." Paul shows us that Peter had faults.</font></p>
<p>Here's what we do with the Acts of the Apostles.<b> The Epistles (letters) of the New Testament to Believers were inspired by the Holy Spirit to be doctrinal for us.</b> <b>We
see the doctrine in these letters and then get an insight into the
historical setting in which these doctrines were being practiced by
seeing these practices in the Book of Acts.</b> For example, we see the
qualifications for a deacon in <a href="10-28.html#Qualifications" title="I Timothy 3 Summary" target="_blank">I Timothy 3 (see notes)</a>, but we need <a title="Acts 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=7&amp;dy=8#Help" target="_blank">Acts 6 (see notes)</a> to see
the necessity that prompted their selection. I was once a member of a
very small congregation that believed every church, regardless of size,
should have exactly seven deacons - no more, no less. This number had
been adopted because this was the number chosen in <a title="Acts 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=7&amp;dy=8#Help" target="_blank">Acts 6 (see notes)</a>. The Book of Acts was not meant to be used in that fashion. <b>We
may look at actions by the notable characters of this Book and weigh
them against the doctrinal content of the Epistles of the New Testament
in order to determine how we'll apply doctrinal principles. It's a
dangerous precedent to use the Book of Acts as a one-stop doctrinal
book.</b></p>
<p><a name="Resurrection"></a><font size="4"><b>What happened for the six weeks after the resurrection? (Acts 1:1-11)<br>
	</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 &para; The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, <br />
2 until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen, <br />
3 to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. <br />
4 &para; And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;you have heard from Me;<br />
5 for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&rdquo;<br />
6 Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?&rdquo; <br />
7 And He said to them, &ldquo;It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority.<br />
8 But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.&rdquo;<br />
9 &para; Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. <br />
10 And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, <br />
11 who also said, &ldquo;Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven.&rdquo; <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;former account&quot; of verse 1 is a reference to the Gospel of Luke. Jesus
  taught his disciples for 40 days (verse 3) after his resurrection prior
  to his ascension in verses 9-11. Luke includes a bit of overlap with his Gospel account of <a href="6-30.html#Commission" title="Luke 24 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 24:49-51 (see notes)</a> where he reported the ascension of Jesus. In that account, Luke gives the last-minute instructions from Jesus prior to his resurrection, &quot;Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.&quot; Luke recaps those instructions again here in Acts 1:4, &quot;And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, 'which,' He said, 'you have heard from Me.'&quot; It is interesting to note that the
  disciples in verse 6 once again seek the answer to the most frequently
  pondered question of Jesus' entire ministry, "Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" Keep in mind who Jesus
  Christ is - the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies of the
  Messiah (Christ i.e. anointed one) who is to rule the earth from
  Jerusalem upon the restored throne of David. <b>They want to know if Jesus plans to initiate this kingdom and rule right now. The answer: not right now.</b> Then, as his last words before his final first-advent ascension, he
  commissions his disciples in verse 8 with instructions to take his
  message world wide; these instructions coincide with those we commonly refer to as &quot;The Great Commission&quot; found in <a href="6-30.html#Commission" title="Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 28:16-20, Mark 16:15-20 and Luke 24:44-53 (see notes)</a>. These instructions are in contrast to the near-exclusive outreach
  to Jews only during the earthly ministry of Jesus. The ability to
  effectively proclaim this message will be facilitated by the
  empowerment of the Holy Spirit, to be made manifest in Acts 2 (<a href="#Pentecost">see below</a>) a few
  days later. </p>
<p>Finally, in verses 9-11 we see the ascension with the
  promised return by, presumably, two angels. Their comments regarding the ascension of Jesus are quite precise in verse 11, &quot;Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven.&quot; </p>
<p>This last meeting with Jesus' disciples takes place on Mount Olivet. <strong>Therefore, based upon verses 9-11, it is to be assumed that these comments mean that Jesus' return will be:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Personal according to <a href="12-11.html#Top" title="Revelation 1 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 1:7 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him. Even so, Amen.&quot;</li>
  <li>Visible (Battle of Armageddon, <a href="12-27.html#Armageddon" title="Revelation 19 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 19:11-21, see notes</a>)</li>
  <li>To the Mount of Olives (aka Mount Olivet), <a href="12-20.html#Turmoil" title="Zechariah 14 Summary" target="_blank">Zechariah 14:4 (see notes)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Incidentally, if
you wondered where the crucifixion became known as the "Passion of
Christ," here it is in verse 3 (KJV), "To whom also he shewed himself
alive after his <b>passion</b> by many infallible proofs, being seen
of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the
kingdom of God:" The Greek word (pascho) translated passion there is
used 42 times in the New Testament, but only translated "passion" one
time. It is almost always translated "suffer," as it is in the NKJV in this verse.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Commission" id="Commission"></a>Let's
make special mention of Acts 1:8 here since it becomes an important
motivation for the actions of the remainder of the Book of Acts.</span><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Acts 1:8 But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.<br>
</div>
<p><br>
  It is unlikely that the thousands of Jews who received Christ on the
  Day of Pentecost had any idea that they would be sharing their
  new-found faith in Christ with Gentiles. However, the command of Christ
  here in Acts 1:8 is quite clear - Samaritans...and...Gentiles
  ("to the end of the earth&quot;). This commission unfolds quickly in the
  Book of Acts; the Samaritans are evangelized in <a title="Acts 8 Summary" target="_blank" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=7&amp;dy=12#Saul">Acts 8 (see notes)</a> and the Gentiles (Cornelius) in <a title="Acts 10 Summary" target="_blank" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=7&amp;dy=16#Peter">Acts 10 (see notes)</a>. Afterward, Paul goes everywhere preaching to anyone who will listen - Jews, Samaritans and Gentiles.</p>
<p>Allow me to add a plausible speculation here regarding the motivation of these early Believers. From the commission of Acts 1:8, it seems likely that these early disciples thought that the evangelization of the Jews, Samaritans and Gentiles was all that stood in the way of the Kingdom Age. I make that observation based upon the question that was asked in verse 6. They want to know if now is the time to establish that Kingdom on earth. Jesus replies with this commission. That would understandably lead many of them to conclude that as soon as these mentioned were evangelized, the Kingdom could be established. That may serve to explain many of the actions of these early disciples.<br>

Using extra-scriptureal sources, we are able to make this determination based upon the writings of Josephus. This Jewish historian defines the distance between the Mount of Olives and Jerusalem to be five &quot;stadia&quot; (Antiquities of the Jews, Book 20, Chapter 8, Section 6). That would make &quot;a Sabbath day's journey&quot; a distance of approximately 1,000 yards.<br />

	</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">12 &para; Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey. <br />
13 And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: Peter, James, John, and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas the son of James. <br />
14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers. <br />
15 &para; And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, <br />
16 &ldquo;Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; <br />
17 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.&rdquo; <br />
18 &para; (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. <br />
19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) <br />
20 &para; &ldquo;For it is written in the Book of Psalms:<br />
&ldquo;Let his dwelling place be desolate,<br />
And let no one live in it&rsquo;; and,<br />
&lsquo;Let another take his office.&rsquo;<br />
21 &para; &ldquo;Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, <br />
22 beginning from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.&rdquo; <br />
23 &para; And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. <br />
24 And they prayed and said, &ldquo;You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen<br />
25 to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.&rdquo; <br />
26 And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>It's ten days before the Feast of Pentecost,</b> and the disciples have been told (verse 4) not to leave Jerusalem, "but to wait for the Promise of the Father." Luke recorded Jesus' words like
  this in Luke 24:49, "Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high."</p>
<p>While in the upper room, Peter takes charge. He decides to
replace the fallen Judas Iscariot rather than just wait as they were
instructed to do. <b>In verses 21-22 Peter, through deductive
reasoning, outlines the qualifications for a replacement Apostle as
follows: he must be an eyewitness of Jesus' ministry from John's
baptism to the ascension including the resurrection. </b>Then they cast lots to choose between two candidates who meet this criteria. Matthias won the lottery. That's right; it wasn't a vote to elect; it was more like throwing dice. That's what &quot;casting lots&quot; means. <a title="Proverbs 16 Summary" href="7-31.html#Lots" target="_blank">For a more complete look at the practice of casting lots, click here.</a> In the Old Testament they depended upon God to direct the outcome. Incidentally, if the Book of Acts is to be used as a doctrinal book on its own (<a href="#Acts">see the discussion in the introduction above</a>), shouldn't Christians be making important decisions today based upon the use of a lottery? After Peter quotes David as his justification (<a title="Psalm 69 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=6&amp;dy=25#David" target="_blank">Psalms 69:25, see notes</a>; <a title="Psalm 109 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=7&amp;dy=11#Enemies" target="_blank">Psalm 109:8, see notes</a>)
for doing so, they now have their twelfth Apostle. When you take a look
at those two Psalms, you must admit that Peter used a lot of latitude
in selecting those two verses as justification for his actions.</p>
	<p><b>Here's a problem though. Paul claimed to be an Apostle, </b>and he uses similar criteria in <a title="I Corinthians 9 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=2#Apostle" target="_blank">I Corinthians 9:1 (see notes)</a>, "Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?" <b>Does he mean that he should be numbered with the other eleven as the twelfth Apostle instead of Matthias?</b>
Well, let's look at <a title="I Corinthians 9 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=2#Apostle" target="_blank">I Corinthians 9:5 (see notes)</a>, "Do we have no right to take along a believing wife, as do also the other apostles, the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?" Does it not appear that Paul is comparing his
apostleship to that of the original eleven? So, based upon his
Damascus-road experience of seeing Jesus there, Paul seems to be
indicating that he meets the criteria for Jesus-selected apostleship.
Now, for those who would maintain that both Matthias and Paul were
Apostles by that standard criteria,<b> look at the words of Jesus in </b><a title="Matthew 19 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=4&amp;dy=23#Reward" target="_blank"><b>Matthew 19:28</b> (see notes)</a><b>,</b>
"Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, <b>you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."</b> But wait! There's more. We see the New Jerusalem which is established in Revelation 21. Look at <a title="Revelation 21 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=31#Jerusalem" target="_blank">Revelation 21:14 (see notes)</a>,
"Now the wall of <strong>the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</strong>" So, who's the twelfth Apostle,
Matthias or Paul? Is it possible that Peter over stepped his authority
by selecting a successor to Judas based upon the lottery? Isn't it more
likely that the Jesus-selected Paul is to be the name written on one of
those foundations in the New Jerusalem rather than Matthias?</p>

5 &para; And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. <br />
6 And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. <br />
7 Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, &ldquo;Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? <br />
8 And how is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born? <br />

	<p>Of course the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are bigger events,
	  but we're talking church history here. The Feast of Pentecost came each
	  year 50 days after the first Sabbath following the Passover. Therefore,<b> it always fell on a Sunday.</b>
	  As 120 of Jesus' disciples are gathered in a room in Jerusalem on this
	  no-work Jewish holiday, the Holy Spirit is manifested among them in a
	  three-fold miracle:</p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>The three-fold miracle on the Day of Pentecost:</b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>A mighty rushing wind filled the room (verse 2)			</li><li>Fire danced on their heads (verse 3)
			</li><li>They spoke in languages familiar to those viewing this experience (verses 4-12)		</li></ul>
		<p><b>By
the way, when people talk about having the Pentecostal experience
present in their church services, how many of the three miracles of the
Day of Pentecost are present? If you say one, let me remind you that
those languages spoken were heard as real languages (verse 8), not
unknown. Now how many?</b> If this discussion interests you, click here to see the summaries on <a title="I Corinthians 12-13 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=6" target="_blank">I Corinthians 12-13 (see notes)</a> and <a title="I Corinthians 14 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=10" target="_blank">I Corinthians 14 (see notes)</a> for additional perspective regarding "speaking in tongues."</p>
		<p>The miracle of the Day of Pentecost facilitated the message which Peter preached inviting these Jews to receive Christ as Savior. I'm relatively certain that Peter is exercising here an authority which was given to him by Jesus himself in <font size="3"><a title="Matthew 16:13-20 Summary" href="7-16.html#Peter" target="_blank">Acts 10:24-48, see notes)</a>. On all three occasions it was Peter who was entrusted to deliver the message of the Gospel preceded by miracles. Therefore it seems logical that the &quot;keys&quot; of Matthew 16 are used on these three occasions to open the Gospel door to the whole world.</p>

And the moon into blood,<br />
Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the LORD. <br />
21 	And it shall come to pass<br />
That whoever calls on the name of the LORD<br />
Shall be saved.&rsquo;<br />
22 &para; &ldquo;Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know&mdash; <br />
23 Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death; <br />
24 whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it. <br />
25 For David says concerning Him:<br />
&ldquo;I foresaw the LORD always before my face,<br />
For He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.<br />
26 	Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad;<br />
Moreover my flesh also will rest in hope.<br />
27 	For You will not leave my soul in Hades,<br />
Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.<br />
28 	You have made known to me the ways of life;<br />
You will make me full of joy in Your presence.&rsquo;<br />
29 &para; &ldquo;Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. <br />
30 Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne, <br />
31 he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption. <br />
32 This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses. <br />
33 Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear. <br />
34 &para; &ldquo;For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself:<br />
&ldquo;The LORD said to my Lord,<br />
&lsquo;Sit at My right hand,<br />
35 	Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;<br />
36 &para; &ldquo;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&rdquo; <br />
37 &para; Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &ldquo;Men and brethren, what shall we do?&rdquo; <br />
38 &para; Then Peter said to them, &ldquo;Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <br />
39 For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.&rdquo; <br />
40 &para; And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, &ldquo;Be saved from this perverse generation.&rdquo; <br />
41 Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added to them.<br />

		  Peter stands up to preach for the sake of the Judeans who were mocking

		  drunk!" What a way to start a message. Then he explains the provisions
		  of the New Covenant of <a title="Jeremiah 31 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=30#Covenant" target="_blank">Jeremiah 31:31-34 (see notes)</a>, while not naming it specifically.

				<td><b>The Dual Usage of LORD/Lord in the New Testament</b>
					<p><font size="2">Peter quotes Psalm 110:1 in Acts 2:34 when he says, "The <b>LORD</b> said unto my <b>Lord</b>,
Sit thou on my right hand." In the Old Testament, it is common usage in
English Bibles to write "LORD" in all capital letters when translating
the Hebrew word "Jehovah" aka "Yahweh" (the unique name of the God of
the Jews). When the Old Testament Hebrew word is "adown" (or a
variation thereof, meaning "master"), the first letter only is
capitalized when it refers to God, and no letters are capitalized when
it refers to a man, depending on context. However, in the New
Testament, there is no unique translation for the Old Testament
"Jehovah." The same Greek word, "kurios" is used to convey both Old
Testament renderings ("Jehovah" or "master") as is the case in Acts
2:34 where "kurios" is used in both occurrences. Context only is used
to differentiate them. Since it is a direct quotation of Psalm 110:4,
we conclusively know that both Old Testament Hebrew words are used
here; therefore, the typeface in Acts 2:34 makes the differentiation
for us. Since "kurios" is used 747 times in the New Testament,
sometimes describing the role of "Jehovah" and sometimes contextually
meaning "master," it is important to examine the context in which the
word "kurios" is translated "LORD/Lord/lord" in every instance in order
to ascertain the correct idea which is to be conveyed by the usage
within the passage.</font></p>

		<p><strong>Peter preaches a powerful message including proofs that Jesus was the long-awaited Messiah.</strong> He even quotes David from <a title="Psalm 16 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=5&amp;dy=30#Favorites" target="_blank">Psalms 16:10 (see notes)</a> in verses 27, 31, and then from <a title="Psalm 110 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=7&amp;dy=11#Messianic" target="_blank">Psalm 110:1 (see notes)</a>
in verses 34-35. Peter pulls no punches in accusing the crowd of
thousands who were now listening that they had crucified the Messiah in
verse 36, "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, <strong>whom you crucified</strong>, both Lord and Christ." When Peter gets to the invitation, three thousand are
saved and baptized. It turns out to be a great day at church...and it
all happened on a Sunday. <b>As a matter of fact, this event goes down in history as the formal birth of the New Testament church.</b></p>
	<p><a name="Acts 2:38"></a><b>Peter's invitation to receive Jesus as savior in Acts 2:38 merits some explanation.</b>
Peter says, "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." Many today have disregarded the circumstances and
have built elaborate extra-scriptural doctrines upon these words. First
of all, some have concluded (without supporting scripture from the
epistles) that water baptism is essential as a requirement to one's
actual salvation experience. In other words, they conclude that one is
not actually saved until after water baptism. There is no other
scripture to support this notion. <a title="Romans 6 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=8&amp;dy=17#Baptism" target="_blank">For a fuller discussion on water baptism, see the notes on Romans 6:1-14 by clicking here.</a></p>
	<p>Now, what about the invitation to "repent" in that verse? First of all,
		  understand this: Saving faith is saving faith...period. <a title="Galatians 2 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=26#Contrast" target="_blank">Galatians 2:16 (see notes)</a> says, "knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ..." The NKJV inaccurately substitutes &quot;faith in&quot; rather than &quot;faith of&quot; rendered by the KJV. Be sure to follow the hyperlink to Galatians 2:16 to see the explanation with regard to the Greek text. That "faith of Jesus Christ" package
		  includes "repentance." Here Peter emphasizes repentance because these
		  aren't your typical non Believers; they are already religious, but have
		  rejected Jesus as the Messiah up to this point. So...Peter
		  appropriately invites them to "repent" (Greek: "metanoeo" meaning "to
		  change one's mind or attitude"). These Jews were missing an important
		  component in their traditional religious persuasion - the Messiah
		  prophesied in their own scriptures. They weren't just missing Jesus,
		  they had rejected him - turned their backs on him. Now it's time for
		  them to turn around i.e. accept that Jesus really is their long-awaited
		  Messiah. </p>
	<p>So...why did he invite them to be baptized here if not as a
		  condition of salvation? It was undoubtedly a matter of practice. Our
		  modern-day paradigm for an invitation consists of standing in front of
		  our seats while listening to a plea for people to move to the aisle,
		  come down front and profess Jesus as their savior. With thousands
		  gathered around shoulder to shoulder listening to Peter preach, there
		  were no aisles - no place for 3,000 people to stand down front.
		  Therefore, the ONLY practical way to identify with Christ that day was
		  to go ahead and follow Peter down to the river and be baptized by
		  water. That's their way of identifying with Christ on that occasion.
		  You will notice that the invitation of Acts 3:19 (<a href="#Acts%203:19">see below</a>) did not include baptism. Peter proclaims that the receipt of the Holy Spirit comes at salvation in his invitation (<a title="I Corinthians 12 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=6#Corinthians" target="_blank">see notes on I Corinthians 12:13</a>). <a title="What The Bible Says About Eternal Life" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Eternal_life.html" target="_blank">For a thorough explanation of what it means to be "saved," click here.</a></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>They shared everything (Acts 2:42-47)</b></font><br>
	</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles&rsquo; doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers. <br />
43 Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. <br />
44 Now all who believed were together, and had all things in common, <br />
45 and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as anyone had need. <br />
46 &para; So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, <br />
47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved. <br />
		  </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>These
		  early Believers were excited about the Lord's workings in their midst.
		  Notice verses 46-47, "So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,  praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved." They went to the temple to share daily as well as from house
		  to house. They were excited about the Christian life.</p>
	<p><b>Notice the practice of these new Believers in the aftermath of the Pentecostal experience:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The sold their possessions and contributed the proceeds to the Christian community (verses 44-45)
			</li><li>They met together as Believers daily at the temple and in one another's homes (verse 46)
			</li><li>They shared meals on a daily basis in one another's homes (verse 46)
		</li></ul>
		<p>These
new Believers were excited about life in Christ. As seen in these
verses, their daily-living practices were completely absorbed in
serving Christ and fellowshipping with those who do. It is likely that these early Christians thought that the Kingdom Age could start at any time. The disciples had asked the question regarding the timing of the beginning of the Kingdom on earth in Acts 1:6-7. In reply, Jesus issued them the evangelism commission of Acts 1:8. It seems plausible that they probably thought as soon as those people mentioned there were evangelized, the Kingdom Age could begin. Therefore, why do they need earthly possessions? They just wanted to get to the task at hand.</p>
		<p><a name="Man"></a><font size="4"><b>Peter heals a lame man (Acts 3)<br>
	</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p> <font size="2">1 Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.<br />
2 And a certain man lame from his mother&rsquo;s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered the temple; <br />
3 who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms. <br />
4 And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, &ldquo;Look at us.&rdquo; <br />
5 So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. <br />
6 Then Peter said, &ldquo;Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.&rdquo; <br />
7 And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. <br />
8 So he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them&mdash;walking, leaping, and praising God. <br />
9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God. <br />
10 Then they knew that it was he who sat begging alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. <br />
11 &para; Now as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Solomon&rsquo;s, greatly amazed. <br />
12 So when Peter saw it, he responded to the people: &ldquo;Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? <br />
13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let Him go. <br />
14 But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, <br />
15 and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. <br />
16 And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. <br />
17 &para; &ldquo;Yet now, brethren, I know that you did it in ignorance, as did also your rulers. <br />
18 But those things which God foretold by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled. <br />
19 Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, <br />
20 and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before, <br />
21 whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began. <br />
22 For Moses truly said to the fathers, &ldquo;The LORD your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever He says to you. <br />
23 And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.&rsquo;<br />
24 Yes, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those who follow, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days. <br />
25 You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, &ldquo;And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&rsquo;<br />
26 To you first, God, having raised up His Servant Jesus, sent Him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.&rdquo; </font> </p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Peter
		  and John go to the temple where they see the lame man there begging as
		  usual. Peter gets right to the point in verse 6, "Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk." And he does! He goes right into the temple
		  with Peter and John to the amazement of those standing around watching. <b>I feel a message coming on!</b> Peter recognizes an opportunity to
		  preach and gets right to the facts in verse 14, "But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you" If
		  that wasn't clear enough, Peter says to the crowd of Jews in verse 15
		  that they had "killed the Prince of life." <b>Whoa! That's some heavy preaching!</b> Isn't Peter afraid someone is going to get a little angry at statements like that? No worry; <b>Peter is empowered and emboldened by the Holy Spirit.</b>
		  Peter's message, like that of Acts 2, is a historical progression of
		  God's working with Israel to bring the Messiah and salvation to them.
		  The bottom line is the same: <b>You need to receive Jesus Christ as your savior.</b>
		  Now Peter drives the point home once again: This lame man was healed
		  through faith in this very same Messiah/savior whom you crucified.</p>
	<p><a name="Acts 3:19"></a><b>The invitation of Acts 3:19 requires some explanation,</b>
"Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out." Peter is preaching to an audience gathered at the temple. We
assume, therefore, these are practicing Jews gathered there at the
"hour of prayer" (verse 1). Again, as on the Day of Pentecost, these
aren't your typical non Believers; they are already religious, but have
rejected Jesus as the Messiah up to this point. So...Peter
appropriately invites them to "repent" (Greek: "metanoeo" meaning "to
change one's mind or attitude") and "be converted" (Greek: "epistrepho"
meaning "to turn around or turn toward"). In other words, they were
missing an important component in their traditional religious
persuasion - the Messiah prophesied in their own scriptures. They
weren't just missing Jesus, they had rejected him - turned their backs
on him. Now it's time to turn around (repent and be converted) and see
that Jesus, after all, is their long anticipated Messiah. Peter's
invitation is not a typical invitation for salvation because these
weren't typical people to whom he was speaking. However, the "faith of
Christ" (<a href="#Acts%202:38">see discussion above</a>) is what is needed for salvation here; a component of the "faith of Christ" is repentance.</p>
	<p><a name="Moses"></a><b>Incidentally, notice the clear reference in verse Acts 3:22-23 to the prophecy of Moses concerning the Messiah</b>,
"For Moses truly said to the fathers, 'The LORD your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever He says to you.  And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.'" Peter is making a clear reference to <a title="Deuteronomy 18 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=4&amp;dy=12#Prophet" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 18:15-22 (see notes)</a>
where Moses prophesies the coming Messiah. Jews in the first century
all looked forward to the time when Deuteronomy 18:15-22 would be
fulfilled. Peter proclaims to them that this has already happened in
the person of Jesus Christ. For more information on this prophecy of Moses, <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Moses-Messiah.html" title="Moses-Messiah" target="_blank">see the article entitled, &quot;Moses prophesied the Messiah.&quot;</a></p>
