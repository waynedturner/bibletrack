        <p>There has been considerable discussion among scholars regarding the &quot;feast&quot; referenced in verse 1. Is it the Passover Feast? Does it really matter? Well, it does matter if you want to track the length of Jesus' ministry. John only, of the four Gospel writers, logs the occurrences of the Passover Feasts leading up to the last one when Jesus was crucified. The first is found in <a href="4-7.html#Israel" title="Luke 13 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 13:1-9 (see notes)</a>. In that passage Jesus gives a reprieve to the fig tree which seems to be analogous to his ministry to Israel. That period after the reprieve just happens to be three-plus years in that passage. </p>
        <p>If the &quot;feast&quot; in verse 1 is not the second Passover Feast, based upon what I believe is probably a declaration in <a href="4-7.html#Israel" title="Luke 13 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 13:1-9 (see notes)</a> of a three-plus year ministry, then this feast would be one of the other two major feasts in the same year - the Feast of Weeks (seven weeks after the Passover) or the Feast of Tabernacles (six months after the Passover). That still leaves a three-year-plus ministry scenario intact.</p>

                4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. <br>

                14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. <br>
                15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. </font></p>

		<p><font size="3">The sick folks are gathered by the pool in Jerusalem waiting for the angel to stir the water - first one in afterward got healed. This <i>impotent</i> (Greek: astheneo - meaning: sick, weak, impotent) man could never make it to the water before another because he was so weak. Jesus solves that problem in John 5:8, &quot;Jesus saith unto him, <b>Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</b>&quot; That's awesome bedside manner! Well that sets off more fireworks. This takes place in Jerusalem during the time of one of the festivals (probably Passover) when Jews are present from everywhere practicing their best Judaistic stuff. When a Jewish big wig sees the impotent man carrying his bed around, never mind that he hasn't been able to do this for the last 38 years; the big issue becomes, <b>&quot;Hey! you can't be carrying your bed around on the Sabbath!&quot;</b> Now the talk centers around who told the man he could &quot;break the law&quot; by carrying his bed on the Sabbath. <b>Wow...first day out on his new wheels and he gets ticketed by the religion police! This was a sad bunch of religionists, don't you agree?</b> On first interrogation, the man does not know to identify Jesus as the healer. Later after a meeting with Jesus in the temple,  the man is able to identify him, and these Jewish religionists go at it again in an attempt to entrap Jesus.</font> </p>

                  <p><font size="2">According to Dr. Larry Wade, a tour guide to Israel who has conducted nearly 70 tours, the Pool of Bethesda is one of the few Biblical sites about which there is virtually no dispute regarding its current location. The Biblical Pool of Bethesda dates back to Old Testament times; it is near the Gate of Benjamin (Zechariah 14:4), the Sheep Gate (Nehemiah 3:1,12:39), the Lions Gate (in Jesus' Time) and Stephen's Gate (the place where Stephen was martyred). The earliest reference to the UPPER POOL is from the 8th Century B.C. in Isaiah 7:3. The pools were reconstructed in 219-196 B.C. There are two pools, upper and lower, divided by a wall 20ft wide and running east to west. They are surrounded by 5 porches along the northern edge of the Temple Mount. Today (2006) archeologists are unearthing a new pool next to  these two pools.  This pool is most likely the much larger &quot;Pool of Israel&quot; constructed in the days of Herod the Great. </font></p>

    <p><font size="3"><b>A couple of points should be made regarding this episode with the Jewish leaders.</b> First of all, there is <b>NO law within the Law of Moses that would have forbidden the man from carrying his bed around on the Sabbath day.</b> The Pharisees made that one up; it was part of their oral tradition where they had embellished the Law of Moses. Secondly, notice in verses 11 and 15 how that this healed man seems to be something less than grateful to Jesus for his newly-acquired ability to walk. When questioned about his infraction, he first blames &quot;he that made me whole&quot; for his own violation of the Jews' law; upon discovery of Jesus' identity, he then even makes a return trip back to the Jews to report that Jesus was the one responsible. Come to think of it, I've met Christians who seemed ungrateful to our Lord for the marvelous grace of God that has been extended to them through the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">It should also be noted that <b>Jesus healed just the one man that day next to the Pool of Bethesda.</b> That's significant because of the fact that there would have been a host of sick people next to that pool, but Jesus chose just one to heal. It is important to remember that, while Jesus had power over physical sickness, his mission was to redeem mankind from spiritual sickness by his death on the cross. These miracles of healing were necessary to establish his identity as the prophesied Messiah.</font> Jesus framed this mission near the beginning of his ministry in <a href="1-21.html#Jews" title="Luke 4 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 4:16-21 (see notes)</a>.</p>

		<p>Nothing matters to these Jewish leaders except that their reputations and positions were being threatened by Jesus. Jesus tells them in verse 17, &quot;My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.&quot; Subsequently, they use this occasion of healing as another reason why Jesus needs to be dead, as we see in John 5:18, &quot;Therefore <b>the Jews sought the more to kill him</b>, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, <b>making himself equal with God.</b>&quot; Here's the reality on this: These Jewish leaders were familiar with the prophecy of the Messiah in <a href="9-16.html#Messiah" title="Isaiah 9 Summary" target="_blank">Isaiah 9:6-7 (see notes)</a>, &quot;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and <strong>his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</strong>  Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.&quot; That passage clearly establishes that the Messiah will be God on earth. The problem is that the Jewish leaders were corrupt and Jesus had identified them as such on more than one occasion. </p>

  <p>Jesus walks a fine line when speaking to the Jewish leaders, just as he always did.<b> There would come a time when Jesus would lay down his life as he had already prophesied in </b><a title="John 2 Summary" href="1-17.html#Born" target="_blank"><b>John 3:14</b> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> However, that time would be chosen by Jesus, not these hypocrites. <b>They are looking for Jesus to say something that is clearly indisputable evidence of blasphemy.</b> You will notice that Jesus often answers them by referring to himself in third person rather than first person, as he does here when <b>he refers to himself as &quot;the Son.&quot; </b>It would have been much simpler for the Jews to entrap Jesus if he would just say &quot;I&quot; (first person) rather than &quot;the Son&quot; (third person). He follows this pattern until verse 24 when he says, &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth <b>my</b> word, and believeth on him that sent <b>me</b>, hath <b>everlasting life</b>, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.&quot; They must have thought, <b>&quot;Ahhhh! We got him!&quot;</b> Well, maybe not. Jesus uses the personal pronoun &quot;my,&quot; but that quotation standing alone does not give them the evidence they need to say that he called himself God. It's very clear to everyone, but in a court of law, that could be understood to mean only that he was a prophet. However, when we read that verse in the context with the whole discourse, it is obvious to those listening (and to those of us reading) that <b>Jesus is clearly saying that he is God in the flesh.</b> He then goes back to third-person references down through verse 29. <b>Jesus clearly identifies himself in verse 27 as God in the flesh when he says he has the &quot;authority to execute judgment,&quot;</b> but he again uses third-person references so that these words can't be used as evidence of blasphemy by the Jews. <b>As a matter of fact, Jesus refers to himself as &quot;the Son&quot; 10 times between verses 19 and 27.</b></p>
  <p><b>Let's take a closer look at this reference to &quot;the Son&quot; that Jesus repeatedly uses in the presence of these Jewish leaders.</b> Notice <a title="Daniel 7 Summary" href="12-12.html#Messiah" target="_blank">Daniel 7:13 (see notes)</a>, &quot;I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.&quot; No question there - that's a reference to the Messiah. However, Ezekiel refers to himself as the &quot;son of man&quot; 93 times in his prophecy. While Jesus is referred to as the &quot;Son of God&quot; 28 times in the Gospel accounts, he never uses it as a self reference. When your only interest is framing Jesus for blasphemy, one can see the nature of their frustration.</p>
		<p>Beginning with verse 30, it's all back to first-person references, but no statement he makes stands alone as sufficient court evidence for conviction on blasphemy charges. The Jews understand it that way, but it is unusable in court. <b>Ahhhh! Maybe verse 36 will provide sufficient evidence, </b>&quot;But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.&quot; Well, I guess not. In court that could again be taken as a reference to Jesus being a prophet - no blasphemy in being a prophet. So, <b>notice closely in this section that Jesus fully acknowledges his identity as God in the flesh, but gives them nothing to take to court </b>because of the careful way he expresses it.</p>
		<p>Verse 31 is a little puzzling to us unless we carefully stick to the context that we've been developing here; that's the context of courtroom evidence. Jesus says here, &quot;If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.&quot; In a courtroom scenario, one would be required to have additional witnesses beyond one's own witness. Jesus is making the point that, while his testimony of himself may be disregarded as unreliable in a court of law, he has the additional witness of God himself.</p>
	<p>The two resurrections Jesus mentions in verse 29 are not new concepts to these Jews. <a href="12-13.html#Protection" title="Daniel 12 Summary" target="_blank">Daniel 12:2 (see notes)</a> says, &quot;And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.&quot; </p>
		<p><b>Let's take a look at the collective resurrections that take place in scriptures:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Old Testament Believers - at the resurrection of Jesus (<a title="Matthew 27 Summary" href="10-8.html#Ephesians" target="_blank">Ephesians 4:8-10, see notes</a>)<br>

		<p>Jesus has just finished telling them all about himself in verses 19-36, now it's time to identify these Jewish leaders for exactly who they are.</p>
	<p><b>Notice the itemization that Jesus gives of their standing before God.</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>&quot;Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.&quot; (verse 37)
			<li>&quot;...ye have not his word abiding in you:&quot; (verse 38)
			<li>You don't have eternal life. (verses 39-40)
			<li>&quot;...ye have not the love of God in you...&quot; (verse 42)
			<li>You prefer the honor of men rather than God. (verse 43-44)
			<li>The very words of Moses condemn you. (verse 45-47)
		</ul>
		<p>Well, that pretty much sums up the real position of these Jewish leaders before God. <b>After hearing this, you know they're fumed - all that verbal abuse without a thing to take to court! </b>But Jesus had issued them a challenge in verses 39-40, &quot;<b>Search the scriptures</b>; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.&quot; Just as Isaiah had prophesied in<a title="Isaiah 53 Summary" href="10-7.html#Isaiah" target="_blank"> Isaiah 53 (see notes)</a>, they rejected Jesus.</p>
		<p>The Old Testament prophets frequently prophesied the coming Messiah. Had these Jewish leaders carefully studied those prophecies, they would have recognized that Jesus was the one. But when did Moses prophesy concerning the Messiah? The answer is <a href="4-12.html#Prophet" title="Deuteronomy 18 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 18:15-22 (see notes)</a>. The Jews of Jesus day understood that passage to be prophetic concerning the Messiah.

		<p><font size="3">Plucking grain out of the fields for personal consumption on the Sabbath day - &quot;No!

And then here's that &quot;Son of man&quot; phrase again in Mark 2:28, &quot;Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.&quot;</font></p>
		<p>I should point out that the KJV rendering of &quot;corn&quot; for the Greek noun &quot;stachus&quot; might be a little confusing to those who know the history of our American corn.

		<p>These Jewish leaders (consisting of scribes, Pharisees and probably a few Sadducees sprinkled in) anticipate that Jesus is about to heal a man on the Sabbath day. They're just licking their chops - another chance to perhaps collect enough evidence on Jesus to prosecute him for blasphemy before the Roman courts.<b> Jesus knows what's on their minds</b>, but heals the man's withered hand anyway. Jesus points out that none of them would object to rescuing an animal on the Sabbath, so why not a human? From their perspective, <b>who cares about consistency?</b> <b>Certainly not these highly-esteemed religious leaders.</b> They immediately seek out the Herodians to tell what has just taken place. The Herodians formed a religious party akin to the Sadducees, but were also sympathetic to the Roman government and it's laws. Moreover, they were also supportive of the kingship of the Herods who reigned in the region. These views were not shared by the Pharisees. Hmmmm...Pharisees and Herodians in cahoots with one another - they must really hate Jesus. <a href="5-9.html#Politicians" title="Matthew 22 Summary" target="_blank">For more detailed information on the Pharisees, Sadducees and Herodians, click here.</a></p>
	<p>Incidentally, Mark is the only one who reports the attitude of Jesus in verse 5 of his account when he says of Jesus, &quot;he had looked round about on them with anger.&quot; The word &quot;anger&quot; there comes from the Greek word &quot;orge.&quot; This word is often translated &quot;wrath&quot; and is so used in <a title="John 3 Summary" href="10-16.html#Mortify" target="_blank">Colossians 3:6 (see notes)</a> in the term &quot;wrath of God.&quot; <b>The wrath of God comes upon hypocrisy.</b></p>
	<p>One more thing: There was no Old Testament passage that forbade healing on the Sabbath. The Pharisees made that one up...one of many laws that appended to the Mosaic Law.</p>
