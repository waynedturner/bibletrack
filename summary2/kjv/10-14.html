		</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">23 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. <br>
    24 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign. <br>
    25 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. <br>
    26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. <br>
    27 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; <br>
    28 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. <br>
    29 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much. <br>
    30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. <br>
    31 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart. <br>
    32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. <br>
    33 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These 11 verses serve as a glowing endorsement of Hezekiah's life and accomplishments. The only comment about his shortcomings in this passage is to be found in verse 25 where it is said, &quot;...there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.&quot; <a title="II Kings 20-21 Summary" href="10-13.html#Die" target="_blank">Take a look at II Kings 20-21</a> to see the details of Hezekiah's pride and subsequent prayer for the lengthening of his life (Remember the sundial incident?). God prospered Hezekiah, and he reserved Judah's fall until after his death. Then Judah's fall was not to the Assyrians, but to the Babylonians.
    </p>
<p>One notable and archaeologically validated accomplishment of Hezekiah is seen in verse 30, &quot;And Hezekiah himself hath stopped the upper source of the waters of Gihon, and directeth them beneath to the west of the city of David, and Hezekiah prospereth in all his work.&quot; This verse adds detail to <a title="II Chronicles 32 Summary" href="9-24.html#Fortifies" target="_blank">II Chronicles 32:2-4 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him. So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?&quot; <br>
					II Chronicles 32:2-4</p>
			</blockquote>

		<p>This tunnel of 1,750 feet supplied the Pool of Siloam inside Jerusalem (a walled city) with fresh water from the Spring of Gihon outside the city. In 1880 an inscription was discovered by a boy who was bathing in the waters of the Gihon Spring. After studying the inscription, it was determined that it had been carved in stone there by Hezekiah's workers to chronicle their success. The tunnel had been hewn from stone coming from two directions - from within the city at the Pool of Siloam and from without the city at the Spring of Gihon. The workers, according to the inscription, met in the middle. The tunnel supplied fresh water to the inhabitants of Jerusalem during the siege of the Assyrians in 701 B.C. Because of the availability of fresh water to Jerusalem coupled with the lack of water outside of Jerusalem (because of the water diversion), the Jews were able to outlast the Assyrians in the attempted, but unsuccessful, takeover.</p>
		<p>The water diversion was just part of Hezekiah's preparation for battle against the Assyrians, as seen in  <a title="II Chronicles 32 Summary" href="9-24.html#Fortifies" target="_blank">II Chronicles 32:1-8 (see notes)</a>.</p>

3 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. <br>
4 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever. <br>
5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. <br>
6 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. <br>
7 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: <br>
8 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. <br>

2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. <br />
3 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. <br />
4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name. <br />
5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. <br />
6 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. <br />
7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: <br />
8 Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them. <br />
9 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel. <br />
10 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, <br />
11 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: <br />
12 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. <br />
13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down. <br />
14 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; <br />
15 Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day. <br />
16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. <br />
17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <br />
18 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.  <br>

  <em><strong>This information regarding Manasseh's repentance toward God is not told in II Kings 21.</strong></em><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2">10 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken. <br>
    11 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. <br>
    12 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, <br>
    13 And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God. <br>
    14 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah. <br>
    15 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city. <br>
    16 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. <br>
    17 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only. <br>
    18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel. <br>
    19 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers. <br>
    20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these 11 verses, Ezra, writing for the returning exiles, shows a side of Manasseh that was not told in II Kings; Manasseh gets a second chance. The Assyrians capture evil Manasseh; then he repents. God honors this prayer of repentance and restores him as King of Judah. We don't know the details of how this jail break took place. Manasseh then tries to undo that which characterized him in the early part of his reign; he tries to return Judah to God. His efforts were a little on the slight side, however. Notice what verse 17 tells us after Manasseh got rid of the idols in the temple, &quot;Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.&quot; Let's get the picture clearly here: <b>They did not tear down those disgusting abominations known as &quot;high places.&quot; They compromised!</b> These pagan altars had been built to the custom specifications of the pagan gods to whom they were dedicated. Instead of tearing them down (as they should have), they simply specified that the offerings they made on those altars were made to God rather than those pagan deities - same place, same ritual, same sacrifice - different words. The Law of Moses specifically required that all sacrifices be made on the altar of God.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The authorship of this Psalm is unknown; likewise, the date of this writing is not apparent. This Psalm is written like a recitation for a pep rally in honor of God's power and faithfulness. It is typical in the Psalms and Prophets to cite reminders for God's people of His faithfulness to them in times past. </p>
<p><strong>Following are the specific instances of God's faithfulness recounted by this Psalmist:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The plagues upon Egypt prior to the Exodus (verses 8-9)</li>
  <li>The conquering of Kings Sihon and Og on the east side of the Jordan just prior to conquering Canaan (verse 10-11)</li>
  <li>The conquering of Canaan itself (verse 12)</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps this is yet another of those crisis situations, and this Psalm is reminding the people that God can do it again. He, indeed, was with Israel in conquering the lands with the false gods as stated. If this was written during the Assyrian siege on Jerusalem, these words take on deep meaning to the inhabitants of that city.</p>
