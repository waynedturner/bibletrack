          The significance of these events cannot be understated. Here's an overview:</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li class="style1">Sennacherib, the King of Assyria has conquered the entire region surrounding Jerusalem (<a href="#Judah">see below</a>), including the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the walled cities of Judah.
  <li class="style1">Only Jerusalem remains unconquered.
  <li class="style1">Hezekiah, the good King of Judah, tries to avoid takeover by sending a large tribute to Sennacherib (<a href="#Sennacherib">see below</a>). It doesn't satisfy the King of Assyria.
  <li class="style1">It's 701 B.C. and Sennacherib has Jerusalem surrounded and cut off with several hundred thousand soldiers.
  <li class="style1">In desperation, Hezekiah sends for advice from the prophet Isaiah.
  <li class="style1">Isaiah prophesies that Jerusalem will not fall to the Assyrians, a remarkable prophecy in light of the very bleak circumstances.			
  <li class="style1">In an incredible turn of events, 185,000 of the Assyrian soldiers surrounding Jerusalem miraculously drop dead one night.			
  <li class="style1">At the same time, word comes that the King of Assyria has trouble back home which needs immediate attention.			
  <li class="style1">The Assyrians leave Jerusalem unconquered and return home, never to return for a second effort.
  </ul>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Judah"></a>Sennacherib Attacks Judah (II Kings 18:13-16)</b></font><br>
		  </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">13 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them. <br>
	      14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. <br>
	      15 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king&rsquo;s house. <br>
	      16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
		<p><font size="3">Sennacherib (705&#150;681 B.C.) is the new King of Assyria. Let's take a moment to once again reiterate some facts about Assyria. Assyria is not the country of Syria. Assyria became a vast empire that sucked up the other countries in that entire region. Assyria was a military kingdom which had established itself by a successful revolt from Babylonia nearly 50 years earlier. It's seat was right there in modern-day Iraq next to the Tigris River. At this point in time the inhabitants of the former Babylonian Empire were now subject to the rule of the Assyrians, as were also all of the countries in that region of the world.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">As we see in these verses, all the fenced cities of Judah, with the exception of Jerusalem, fell to Sennacherib. Hezekiah sought to pay a tribute in lieu of an Assyrian invasion on Jerusalem - ravages his own temple to cough up the funds. Since when is a world conqueror satisfied until he has actually conquered? Sennacherib takes the gold and silver, but Hezekiah's tribute only causes Sennacherib to crave more.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><strong><font color="#FF0000">You will notice in the following account that II Kings 18-19 contain near identical text as Isaiah 36-37. II Chronicles 32 only gives a brief summary of the events. These passages are shown side by side for comparative purposes.</font></strong></font></p>

	<p><font size="3">You will notice that the text of II Kings 18:17-37 is nearly identical to that of Isaiah 36:2-22. The II Chronicles 32 account summarizes, but abbreviates some of the account.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Hezekiah has lost all the fortified cities of Judah to Assyria; only Jerusalem (of the fortified cities) remains. <b>After</b> <b>Hezekiah tries to buy Sennacherib off,</b> King Sennacherib is in Judah with his army, but he sends Rabshakeh, one of his officers, with a great army to speak to Hezekiah in Jerusalem. He hollers out some pretty intimidating threats in Hebrew that are to be reported to Hezekiah, but really, they are designed to intimidate everybody within earshot. He points out that Egypt won't be able to help Jerusalem because they are weak, and the Assyrian army has occupied the territory between Egypt and Judah anyway. </font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Rabshakeh demonstrates his lack of understanding of Israel's worship when he suggests that Hezekiah has destroyed the worship centers of Jehovah, leaving only Jerusalem as a place of worship. He is referring to the pagan altars that Hezekiah had removed during his reign. He then taunts the men of Jerusalem by saying that if Assyria were to provide 2,000 horses, Hezekiah wouldn't even be able to supply the 2,000 fighting men for an army - kind of a wager it appears. This silver-tongued devil (so to speak) goes so far as to say that it was Jehovah who told him to come against Jerusalem (a big fat lie). When it was requested that he speak his words in Aramaic (instead of Hebrew) so the other Jerusalem dwellers would not understand his threatenings, he insists that they need to hear their fate under King Hezekiah by reinforcing this point in a disgustingly graphic way in II Kings 18:27/Isaiah 36:12. </font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Finally, Rabshakeh proclaims, for all to hear, that none of the gods of the other conquered nations had been able to prevent the siege of the Assyrians. Rabshakeh tells them that if they surrender, they will not die, but be deported to quality real estate in a foreign land. <b>All in all, it was a pretty depressing day in Jerusalem.</b> This event was similar to the leaflets the United States dropped to the people of Hiroshima prior to the devastation of that city in World War II. <b>The King of Assyria intended for Rabshakeh's intimidating message to bring about a grass-roots movement for the surrender of Jerusalem.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">You will notice the identical accounts by the writer of II Kings and Isaiah. There is no similar account in II Chronicles of these events.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">It seems to me that it might have been a better idea to consult God's man, Isaiah, before Hezekiah sent all his wealth to Sennacherib. For impact, let's assess the situation: <b>Little ol' Jerusalem is surrounded by hundreds of thousands of Assyrian soldiers</b> who have just conquered all of Jerusalem's neighboring countries along with a large chunk of Judah itself. Now, only a little dot on the map (Jerusalem) still remains unconquered, and the guy outside says it's hopeless to resist. He's even admitted that surrender means deportation to a favorable land, but fighting means death. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">While everybody else in Jerusalem panics, King Hezekiah sends his leaders to Isaiah for consultation. <b>At this point, Isaiah sends a message by them to Hezekiah saying that JERUSALEM WILL NOT FALL! </b>Isaiah tells Hezekiah that God will send Sennacherib and his big ol' army packin' back to Assyria because of a rumored uprising there. </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>That is a remarkable prophecy!</strong></font></p>
