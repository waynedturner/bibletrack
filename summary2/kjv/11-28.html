			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <br>
    2 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers. <br>
    3 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net. <br>
    4 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee. <br>
    5 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. <br>
    6 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee. <br>
    7 And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. <br>
    8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD. <br>
    9 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known. <br>
    10 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. <br>
    11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee. <br>
    12 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. <br>
    13 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. <br>
    14 Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD. <br>
    15 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD. <br>
    16 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD. <br>

<p>Here's yet another prophecy regarding the fall of Egypt; this series began in <a href="11-27.html#Egypt" title="Ezekiel 29 Summary" target="_blank">Ezekiel 29 (see notes)</a>. Based upon the data given to us in verse 1, we know that this one was given in March, 585 B.C., in year 12 and month 12 after Jehoiachin had been dethroned and imprisoned in Babylon - the same time that Zedekiah had become the Babylonian-appointed King of Judah. <b> At this point, Jerusalem has fallen, just as Ezekiel had already prophesied;</b> we see from Ezekiel 33:21 (<a href="#Watchman">see below</a>) that the news of the fall had reached these exiles two months earlier. Misery loves company. </p>
<p>For a comprehensive look at the fall of Jerusalem, <a href="11-11.html#End" title="Jeremiah 52 Summary" target="_blank">click here to see the notes on Jeremiah 52.</a></p>
<p>Since Jerusalem has fallen, what about Egypt? Is God going to do what he said he would with them also? Yup! Here it is in this chapter - the final two prophecies on the fall of Egypt from Ezekiel. Pharaoh's demise gets some mention in this one. Verse 11 makes clear that Babylon is the conquering culprit here.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>And...one more, a</b></font><font size="4"><b> final prophecy on Egypt (Ezekiel 32:17-32)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">17 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <br>
    18 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. <br>
    19 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. <br>
    20 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes. <br>
    21 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword. <br>
    22 Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword: <br>
    23 Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living. <br>
    24 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. <br>
    25 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain. <br>
    26 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living. <br>
    27 And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. <br>
    28 Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword. <br>
    29 There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit. <br>
    30 There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit. <br>
    31 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD. <br>
    32 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD. </font></p>

<p>This prophecy was issued in April, 585 B.C.; it follows by one month the preceding prophecy at the beginning of this chapter and basically assigns Egypt their place with all the other surrounding nations - death and destruction. While Egypt was one of the last nations in the region left standing (so to speak), the nation did fall to the Babylonians around 568 B.C. as Ezekiel had prophesied.</p>

		  <p><font size="2">1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <br>
	      2 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: <br>
	      3 If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; <br>
	      4 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. <br>
	      5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. <br>
	      6 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman&rsquo;s hand. <br>
	      7 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. <br>
	      8 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. <br>
	      9 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. <br>
	      10 Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? <br>
	      11 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? <br>
	      12 Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth. <br>
	      13 When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it. <br>
	      14 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; <br>
	      15 If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. <br>
	      16 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. <br>
	      17 Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. <br>
	      18 When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. <br>
	      19 But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby. <br>
	      20 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways. <br>
	      21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten. <br>
	      22 Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb. <br>
	      23 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <br>
	      24 Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance. <br>
	      25 Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land? <br>
	      26 Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour&rsquo;s wife: and shall ye possess the land? <br>
	      27 Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence. <br>
	      28 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through. <br>
	      29 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed. <br>
	      30 Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD. <br>
	      31 And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness. <br>
	      32 And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not. <br>
	      33 And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them. </font></p>

		<p>There's no need to prophesy concerning the fall of Jerusalem at this point; it's already happened. Ezekiel told them and told them, but all they did was hate him for it. Tough! It's his job to &quot;warn the wicked&quot; (verses 8-9). In verses 10-20, Ezekiel stresses the importance of individual obedience on behalf of these exiled Jews. <b>Then in verse 21 the message comes from an escapee of Jerusalem that the city has fallen.</b> It's been a tough seven-plus years for Ezekiel since he began prophesying about this. As a matter of fact, he didn't speak except to prophesy for the whole time (<a title="Ezekiel 3 Summary" href="11-15.html#God" target="_blank"><b>Ezekiel 3:24-27, </b>see notes</a>). Here in verse 22 we see that he can speak again; his muteness is gone. Ezekiel is told that now the people will know that he had prophesied correctly.</p>
	<p><b>Here are some dates of interest regarding the fall of Jerusalem:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>December/January, 589/588 B.C. - the siege on Jerusalem was begun by the Babylonians.
			<li>September, 586 B.C. - Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians.
			<li>December/January, 586/585 B.C. - The refugee in verse 21 shows up in Babylonia to report the fall.
		</ul>
		<p>You will notice that the siege on Jerusalem lasted for about 31 months. It took 5 months for word to get back to the exiles in Babylonia that Jerusalem had fallen.</p>
		<p><b>Some have taken this passage out of context to be a universal lesson on a Believer's responsibility to witness to the lost and the consequences for not doing so. In rendering this passage as such, they surmise that the physical death spoken of here is really a reference spiritual death and that those who had salvation in Christ can lose it. It's a very dishonest way of teaching that one can lose one's salvation, and it's all done by grossly misrepresenting scripture. Likewise these teachers have done with Ezekiel's comments about his responsibility to warn the Jews in </b><a title="Ezekiel 3 Summary" href="11-22.html#Sins" target="_blank"><b>Ezekiel 18</b> (see notes)</a><b>. As a matter of fact, notice the clarity in this passage that this warning is designed to motivate Ezekiel to take his warning to the &quot;house of Israel&quot; </b>(verses 7, 10, 11, 20).</p>

	      3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. <br>

		<p>In that culture it was common to refer to a nation's leaders as that nation's shepherds. Israel had some bad, bad shepherds - caused the nation to sin and ultimately fall. That's Ezekiel's theme in this chapter. We find the indictment against these leaders in verses 1-10. </p>

	      12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. <br>
	      13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country. <br>
	      14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. <br>
	      15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD. <br>
	      16 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment. <br>
	      17 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats. <br>
	      18 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? <br>
	      19 And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. <br>

		<p>Then, in verses 11-24, we find a promise to gather those scattered sheep back together into one place; that's the millennium. We know so because of the clear mention of David in verse 24. The judgment that takes place here in verse 17 equates to the judgments of <a title="Matthew 25 Summary" href="4-3.html#Pharisees" target="_blank"><b>John 10</b> (see notes)</a><b> angered the Pharisees so much. They immediately would have equated those words with this chapter concerning the coming Messiah.</b></p>
	<p><b>Then we get a taste of what life on earth during the millennium will be like in verses 25-31</b><b>: </b></p>
<ul>
			<li>God will rule with David among the people of Israel
			<li>No fear of harm from predator animals

			<li>Appropriate seasonal rainfall
			<li>Complete security from man or beast
			<li>No more hunger
			<li>A restored relationship between God and the people. 
		</ul>
		<p>A clarification needs to be made to distinguish this period as the Messianic Kingdom. We anticipate the implementation of the kingdom in what we commonly call the millennium. The millennium is a distinct period of 1,000 years presented to us by John in <a href="10-30.html#Covenant" title="Jeremiah 31 Summary" target="_blank">Jeremiah 31:31-34 (see notes)</a>. At the end of the millennium, Satan will be loosed and will subsequently organize a great rebellion of Gentiles against the Messiah. These wicked Gentiles will be comprised of those Gentiles who were born during the millennium and chose not to acknowledge Jesus as Savior and Messiah. There is no scriptural indication that any Jews will join this rebellion.</p>
