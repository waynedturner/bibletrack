<p><font size="3">Notice that this altar of incense was about 18 inches square (1 cubit) on the top. <b>It had one purpose, to burn incense unto the Lord.</b> It was placed immediately outside the curtain that separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place. A special blend of incense (Exodus 30:34-38, <a href="#Anointing">see below</a>) was burned on it in the morning and evening. The Levites carried it with poles through the rings just like the Ark of the Covenant and Brazen Altar. The location directly in front of the curtain that led to the Holy of Holies was strategic. Smoke from this altar found its way into the Holy of Holies. One special activity each year on the Day of Atonement involved using coals from this Altar of Incense (<a href="7-3.html#Day" title="Leviticus 16 Summary" target="_blank">Leviticus 16, see notes</a>) for the purpose of filling a censer for use directly inside the vail. It apparently was to create smoke that would prevent a clear visual image on the part of the High Priest of the Ark of the Covenant.</font></p>

    13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD. <br>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">We saw God's insistence in the building of this tabernacle that all donations be voluntary but not here. This appears to be a<b> flat tax on all adult males to support the service of the Tabernacle</b> along with a count - a census. All the adult men (20 years old and older) would be responsible for this &quot;donation.&quot; Rich or poor - everybody paid the same amount for the continuing service of the tabernacle. This tax amounted to about 1/5th of an ounce of silver. That was then used in <a title="Exodus 38 Summary" href="3-22.html#Lesson" title="Matthew 17 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 17:24-27 (see notes)</a>. This temple tax/census as specified here would have exempted the Levites, since they were never part of the count of 20+ year-old males. As a matter of fact, this tax was collected in order to support the work of the Levites.</p>
<p><a name="Laver"></a><font size="4"><b>The laver - a very nice place to wash up (Exodus 30:17-21)</b></font><font size="2" color="#ff0b11"><br>

  <p><font size="2">17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>

    19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: <br>
    20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: <br>
    21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">This laver doesn't seem to be very large, although we don't have any dimensions for it. It was made of brass - actually the brass taken from the mirrors of the women. Polished brass was the primary means of seeing one's reflection back then. This <b>laver was placed just outside the tent door.</b> The priests had to wash up (hands and feet) before entering &quot;that they die not&quot; (verse 21). Whoa! Maybe &quot;cleanliness really is next to godliness&quot; (an old-timer extra-scriptural saying). And just as we pointed out in <a title="Exodus 28 Summary" href="2-21.html#Clothes" target="_blank">Exodus 28 (see notes)</a>, their feet were uncovered (no shoes) after they washed them at the laver.</font></p>

  <p><font size="2">22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>

    24 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: <br>

    26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, <br>

    31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. <br>
    32 Upon man&rsquo;s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. <br>
    33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people. <br>
    34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: <br>
    35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy: <br>
    36 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. <br>
    37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. <br>
    38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God gives a specific recipe for making the anointing substance for this tabernacle in the wilderness and then some special tabernacle perfume - all to be applied to the tabernacle furnishings. So, do you like the new-tabernacle smell? <b>I wouldn't advise making up your own brew of these two substances at home for personal use </b>(verses 33 and 38)<b>.</b> Look at Exodus 30:38, &quot;Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, <b>shall even be cut off from his people.</b>&quot; This phrase, &quot;cut off from&quot; is used frequently in the Torah (first five books of Old Testament) for various offenses. No one can say for certain whether that means <b>excommunicated from Israel or put to death.</b> Sometimes the context seems to give a hint. In this passage, there's no way to be certain. Either way, don't try to duplicate that tabernacle smell at home. You will notice that Aaron and his sons were also anointed with this same oil in verse 30. David makes reference to this in <a title="Psalm 133 Summary" href="6-12.html#Fellowship" target="_blank">Psalms 133:2 (see notes)</a>, &quot;It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron&#146;s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments.&quot;<font size="3"><b><a title="The Tabernacle" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/image/Tabernacle_layout.gif" target="_blank"></a></b></font></p>

				<p><font size="3">Here we go on this <b>Sabbath-keeping</b> issue again. Don't you get the impression that this was a <b>very important component of keeping the Law of Moses.</b> In verse 13 God says of Sabbath keeping, &quot;...it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations...&quot; And then here's the &quot;cut off from&quot; phrase again in verse 14 for the violators. Interestingly enough, we do see that<b> &quot;cut off from&quot; with regard to keeping the Sabbath did mean death in <a title="Numbers 15 Summary" href="3-21.html#Work" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> For those people who are convinced that New Testament Believers are required to keep the law, they really need to consider these verses and then decide what they intend to do about the Sabbath. But then there's verse 17, &quot;It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:&quot; We don't keep the Sabbath because we are not the &quot;children of Israel.&quot; Maybe you see it now; the whole Law of Moses was given as a covenant between God and Israel.

<p><font size="3" title="Exodus 24 Summary"><b>Moses headed up to the top of the mountain way back in <a href="2-19.html#Mountain"> (see notes)</a><b>. </b>Hey! This kind of revelation doesn't come overnight! Moses has been gone for nearly seven weeks (40 days altogether, Exodus 24:18). The Hebrews become very restless. Somebody do something!</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Secular historical sources tell us that<b> the bull was an important symbol in ancient Egyptian life.</b> The sun was revered as the &#147;valiant bull&#148; and the reigning Pharaoh as &#147;Bull of Bulls.&#148; But far more important in this connection is the fact that &#147;calf&#148; worship was almost universal among all the ancient Semitic peoples. So, <b>when the Hebrews panicked, where did they turn?</b> Aaron, of course - he and Hur had been left in charge. <b>Aaron</b>, Israel's future High Priest, <b>is the answer man.</b> When the people ask for a god, <b>Aaron rolls into action. </b>Hur seems to have stayed out of it. <b>Aaron comes up with a golden calf.</b> In retrospect, it seems like a goofy move on his part. Keep in mind, however, <b>Aaron has had very little in the way of  &quot;priesting&quot; instruction.</b> Their cows seem to be, to some extent, sacred. <b>When they were very hungry, they still didn't eat them, and he knew that, from time to time, God did command them to sacrifice some of their cattle on an altar. They only ate them when God told them to do so.</b> I guess, given his background and experience,<b> it just made sense to Aaron to make a golden calf.</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Look at Aaron's comment upon completion of his masterpiece in Exodus 32:5, &quot;To morrow is a feast to the LORD.&quot; He even uses the word &quot;Jehovah&quot; here in verse 5, but notice what he had said in verse 4, &quot;These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.&quot; Just to be clear, his statement in verse 4 regarding &quot;thy gods&quot; simply isn't compatible with his reference to &quot;Jehovah&quot; in verse 5. Aaron, at this point, was undoubtedly a very confused leader. It's interesting that, after Solomon's kingdom split, Jeroboam (king of the Northern Kingdom) quotes these words of Aaron in verse 4 to justify his two-calf worship in <a title="I Kings 12 Summary" href="8-20.html#Religion" target="_blank">I Kings 12:28 (see notes)</a> when he says, &quot;...behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.&quot; </font></p>

	      9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: <br>

		<p><font size="3">While on the mountain, <b>God tells Moses what's going on</b> down below with the people and the calf. God even quotes Aaron's words in verse 8, &quot;<b>These be thy gods</b>, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.&quot; Aaron declared those words to the people in verse 4. An interesting discussion takes place between God and Moses. God indicates that he can make a great nation (to fulfill his promises to the patriarchs) from the descendants of Moses alone. <b>Moses pleads with God for the people to have another chance.</b> It's amusing to see Moses' negotiating skills here. He reminds God that the Egyptians will get satisfaction out of the demise of the Israelites and then invokes the covenant made with Abraham, Isaac, and Israel (aka Jacob). Ok, Moses, take care of it. </font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Moses makes his trip down off the mountain with the stone tablets containing God's commandments in hand. Look at Exodus 32:19, &quot;And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses&#146; anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.&quot; <b>Wow! Forty days' work down the drain!</b> Now there's an <b>interesting punishment in verse 20. Is that the equivalent of making kids put soap in their mouths?</b> He ground up the golden calf into powder, sprinkled it into the water and made them drink it. Now that's some expensive water! Oh...a couple of other indications here make this occasion even more disgusting. In verse 25 we see that the people around the golden calf were &quot;naked.&quot; Add to that the indication of verse 6 which says the Israelites &quot;rose up to play.&quot; That Hebrew word for &quot;play&quot; (tsaw-khak&acute;) there is the same one used in <a title="Genesis 26 Summary" href="1-27.html#Sister" target="_blank">Genesis 26:8 (see notes)</a> to describe the activities of Isaac and Rebekah and is translated &quot;sporting&quot; where it says, &quot;Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.&quot; Whatever this activity was between Isaac and Rebekah, Abimelech is certain that it's not appropriate behavior between a brother and a sister. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the &quot;play&quot; while they were &quot;naked&quot; around the golden calf here is something more than just bingo.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>So, Aaron, what do you have to say for yourself? (Exodus 32:21-25)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? <br>
    22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief. <br>
    23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. <br>
    24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. <br>
    25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Moses doesn't beat around the bush in talking with Aaron in verse </font>21, &quot;And Moses said unto Aaron, <b>What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?&quot;</b> If somehow Aaron believed he had done the right thing, this question from Moses should have cleared that misconception up immediately. How about Aaron's reply? <b>Did you ever say the wrong thing under pressure and wish you could just take it back?</b> I'm guessing that's exactly the way Aaron felt after his reply in verse 24, &quot;And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then <b>I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.&quot; </b>Now really, Aaron, <b>who believes that?</b> Look at verse 25 to recognize the magnitude of what Aaron had done as the first in command while Moses was away, &quot;And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for <b>Aaron had made them naked</b> unto their shame among their enemies:)&quot; The people were acting like the heathens from whom God had separated them.</p>

						<b><font size="2">The Levites</font></b></div>
					<p><font size="2">This turns out to be a banner day for the Levites. Moses and Aaron were descendants of Levi, but up to this point, the Levites were just one of the 13 tribes of Israel. There were 13 instead of 12 because of Joseph's two son, Ephraim and Manasseh, each getting a portion of Israel's inheritance (<a title="Genesis 48 Summary" href="2-8.html#Jacob" target="_blank">Genesis 49:5-7 (see notes)</a> in which Jacob proclaimed that Levi's descendants would be scattered in Israel. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2">On this day, however, a special position in Israel is secured by the Levites when they step up to Moses' side in Exodus 32:26-29 after the golden-calf incident. As a result of their willingness to serve on that occasion, we see in verse 29, &quot;For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; <b>that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</b>&quot; That &quot;blessing&quot; is realized in <a title="Numbers 3 Summary" href="2-25.html#Atonement" target="_blank"> Exodus 38:21 (see notes)</a>.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2">Thus, both the words of Jacob and the special blessing by Moses given here were fulfilled, inasmuch as the Levites were scattered as the priestly order among the tribes of Israel, but as civil servants serving as substitutes for the honored firstborn position among the Hebrews.</font></p>

	      27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. <br>
	      28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. <br>

    </blockquote>
		<p>The Levites step up to the plate here as the designated police force for phase one of cleaning up the camp. <b>They slay 3,000 by the sword.</b> Who knows for certain what distinguished these 3,000 as worthy of death while others were spared. However, obviously there was a distinction. It appears that the distinction is found in Exodus 32:26, &quot;Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, <b>Who is on the LORD&#146;S side? let him come unto me.</b> And<b> all the sons of Levi</b> gathered themselves together unto him.&quot; It looks like the sons of Levi were a few among many who came to the side of Moses. <b>Those who did not come to the side of Moses were slain by the Levites. In other words, it was a choice.</b></p>
	<p><b>It should be noted that verse 26 marks the turning point for the Tribe of Levi.</b> You will recall that Levi (along with Simeon) was cursed by Jacob in <a title="Genesis 49 Summary" href="3-15.html#Levites" target="_blank">Numbers 3 (see notes)</a>. However, Jacob's words are still fulfilled, inasmuch as they are scattered among the Tribes of Israel without their own specific tribal inheritance when they enter Canaan under Joshua.</p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>What do we do now? (Exodus 32:30-35)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. <br>
	      31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. <br>
	      32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. <br>
	      33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. <br>
	      34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. <br>
	      35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
		<p><font size="3">We see in these verses that the rest of the Hebrews still must pay a penalty for the sin of calf worship they have committed. I guess we're already seeing how severely God will be dealing with the violators of the first four commandments. Moses makes a plea on behalf of his people.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">In analyzing these 6 verses, let's recap what has taken place. The Levites have slain 3,000 of the stubborn sinners, the ones who did not correctly answer the question, &quot;Who is on the LORD'S side?&quot; Moses makes an impassioned plea in verse 32, &quot;Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.&quot; Whoa...that's heavy! What is this &quot;book&quot; anyway? Now don't jump to conclusions here. Obviously the 3,000 people slain by the Levites are blotted out of the &quot;book.&quot; We're talking about physical (not spiritual) salvation here; &quot;blot out&quot; here means the loss of physical life (i.e. death). It would be a spiritual impossibility for Moses to lose his spiritual life here as he makes this offer before God. He is offering his physical life to God on behalf of his Israelite kin. In other words, &quot;If you're going to kill them, just go ahead and kill me while you're at it.&quot; THERE ARE NO IMPLICATIONS OF SPIRITUAL SALVATION IN THIS PASSAGE.</font></p>
