<strong><font size="4">The burnt offering</font></strong><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, <br>
	      2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock. <br>
	      3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. <br>
	      4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. <br>
	      5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron&rsquo;s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <br>
	      6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. <br>
	      7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire: <br>
	      8 And the priests, Aaron&rsquo;s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: <br>
	      9 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <br>
	      10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. <br>
	      11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron&rsquo;s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar. <br>
	      12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: <br>
	      13 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <br>
	      14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. <br>
	      15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar: <br>
	      16 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: <br>
	      17 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>These instructions for the burnt offering are divided into three sections, <b>for cattle (the herd in verses 3-9), sheep or goats (the flock in verses 10-13) and birds (in verses 14-17).</b> These sacrifices were burnt completely on the big ol' brazen altar (7.5 feet square on its surface), except perhaps for the offering of the birds where the &quot;crop&quot; (food canal) of the bird was separated and discarded first. You'll notice that from the cattle and sheep/goats the offering was to be an <b>unblemished male</b><b>;</b> the reason is found in verse 4, &quot;And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.&quot; <b>The word &quot;atonement&quot; means an act of reconciliation.</b> In other words, this is what the Hebrews did when they wanted to ensure a right relationship with God. Notice that the word &quot;sin&quot; is not actually used in this first chapter with regard to this sacrifice. As a matter of fact, neither the word &quot;sin&quot; nor &quot;trespass&quot; is used until we get to the &quot;sin&quot; offering of Leviticus 4:2 (<a href="#Priest">see below</a>). This burnt offering was for the purpose of rededication (whether individual or corporate) to God.</p>
		<p>This &quot;burnt offering&quot; predates Mosaic Law. The Hebrew word for &quot;burnt offering&quot; is &quot;olah,&quot; and it is used of the offering Noah made when leaving the ark in <a href="1-26.html#Abraham" title="Genesis 22 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 22 (see notes)</a>. Notice that the one who provides the offering does most of the work here for the cattle, goats and sheep. It was a very hands-on experience for the one who brought the offering.</p>
	<p>Paul makes reference to this relationship in <a title="Romans 12 Summary" href="8-21.html#Sacrifice" target="_blank">Romans 12:1-2 (see notes)</a> when he says, &quot;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&quot; They sacrificed an innocent animal, and it was burned on the altar. Just prior to the slaying of the animal, the one offering identified with the sacrifice by placing his hand upon the head of the innocent animal (verse 4). The &quot;living sacrifice&quot; of Romans 12:1-2 is a lot less traumatic than the &quot;burnt offering&quot; of Leviticus. One of my Bible professors, Emerson Pent, would always say when he came to this verse, &quot;<b>Here's the problem with the living sacrifice; it keeps crawling off of the altar.&quot; </b>Burnt offerings stayed put! You know what I mean; many Believers have a tendency to run cycles where they get completely surrendered to God's will for their lives, but then they slide away from that commitment (i.e. crawling off of the altar). It is God's intention that we, as Believers, stay continually surrendered as &quot;living sacrifices&quot; on the altar of God's service.</p>

<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon: <br>
	      2 And he shall bring it to Aaron&rsquo;s sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: <br>
	      3 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron&rsquo;s and his sons&rsquo;: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. <br>
	      4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. <br>
	      5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. <br>
	      6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering. <br>
	      7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. <br>
	      8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar. <br>
	      9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <br>
	      10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron&rsquo;s and his sons&rsquo;: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. <br>
	      11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire. <br>
	      12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour. <br>
	      13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. <br>
	      14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears. <br>
	      15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering. <br>
	      16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
		<p><font size="3">Perhaps the term &quot;meat&quot; offering in the KJV is a little confusing. The word &quot;meat&quot; here is used in the context of a description of something that can be eaten. Genesis 1:29 uses the word in this context, &quot;And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for <b>meat</b>.&quot; In other words, <b>these offerings were edible</b>, unlike the burnt offerings which were completely consumed by the fire as they were placed on the brazen altar. You'll notice that these are baked goods - <b>grain offerings </b>(so to speak). Some of this grain sacrifice was burned upon the altar, but notice what happened to the remainder in verse 10, &quot;And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron&#146;s and his sons&#146;: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.&quot; Now that we know the priests will be eating it, let's take a look at how tasty it may have been. <b>Let's see...unleavened bread without honey, but well salted - hmmmm...that sounds like a saltine cracker.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Peace"></a>Finally...an offering we can eat (Leviticus 3)</b></font><br>
    <strong><font size="4">The Peace Offering</font></strong><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. <br>
    2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron&rsquo;s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. <br>
    3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <br>
    4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. <br>
    5 And Aaron&rsquo;s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <br>
    6 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. <br>
    7 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD. <br>
    8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron&rsquo;s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar. <br>
    9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <br>
    10 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. <br>
    11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD. <br>
    12 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD. <br>
    13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. <br>
    14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <br>
    15 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. <br>
    16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the LORD&rsquo;S. <br>
    17 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is called the &quot;peace offering.&quot; The liver, kidneys and all the fat from the animal are burned upon the altar, but<b> the rest is for fine dining.</b> We see this in <a title="Leviticus 7 Summary" href="3-1.html#Peace" target="_blank"><b>Leviticus 7:11-18</b> (see notes)</a> that there were special occasions when these offerings were made and then eaten - happy occasions. You'll notice that it is here that a differentiating statement is made with regard to the diet of the Hebrews in verse 17, &quot;It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, <b>that ye eat neither fat nor blood.</b>&quot; While other cultures ate both, the Hebrews would not as a matter of keeping their covenant with God. </p>
<p><a name="Priest"></a><font size="4"><b>What about when the High Priest sins? (Leviticus 4:1-12)</b></font><br>
  <strong><font size="4">The Sin Offering</font></strong><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
    2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: <br>
    3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering. <br>
    4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock&rsquo;s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD. <br>
    5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock&rsquo;s blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: <br>
    6 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary. <br>
    7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <br>
    8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <br>
    9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away, <br>
    10 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering. <br>
    11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, <br>
    12 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice verse 3, &quot;If <b>the priest that is anointed</b> do sin according to the sin of the people...&quot; I'm going to make a rather safe assumption here: This is undoubtedly a reference to the High Priest. <b>So what happens when the High Priest sins? </b>Well, if he thought he could make a private sacrifice before God, he was mistaken. Step one is to bring and slay an unblemished bull inside the courtyard, but apparently not upon the brazen altar. He then takes the blood of the bull and goes inside the tent itself to sprinkle some at the veil and place some upon the horns at the altar of incense. Then he emerges from the tent, pours all the remaining blood of the bull onto the brazen altar and burns the fat, kidneys and liver there as well. He then picks up the dead carcass of the bull and carries it outside the camp to a &quot;clean place&quot; where he constructs an altar and burns the rest of the carcass there. <b>Whoa...that's a lot of trouble - perhaps an all-day job! It makes me really, really thankful for I John 1:9,</b> &quot;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot; Unlike the Hebrews, a sincere prayer to God for forgiveness, and I'm done.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>What about when everybody sins? (Leviticus 4:13-21)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty; <br>
    14 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. <br>
    15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD. <br>
    16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock&rsquo;s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation: <br>
    17 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail. <br>
    18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <br>
    19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar. <br>
    20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them. <br>
    21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Let's be specific here in verse 13: &quot;And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance...&quot; <b>What about when the congregation inadvertently breaks God's laws?</b> Notice in verse 15 that <b>all the elders get involved.</b> Then the High Priest takes the blood (<b>of a bull</b>) and sprinkles it before the veil of the Tabernacle, burns the blood on on the altar and carries the carcass outside the camp as he did in the previous section.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>What about when a ruler of the people sins? (Leviticus 4:22-26)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty; <br>

    24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering. <br>
    25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering. <br>
    26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;ruler&quot; here refers to the head of a tribe, or of a division of a tribe. After sinning, he gets off with just a <b>male goat</b>. Furthermore, he doesn't have to carry it outside the camp to be burned. But notice that <b>he has to kill the goat himself </b>in verse 24. Then the priest takes over.</p>

    29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering. <br>

</blockquote>
<p>When the common folks inadvertently sin, they bring a <b>female goat or lamb.</b> <b>The one who sinned slays the animal himself</b>, but then the priest takes over and burns the kidneys, liver, fat and blood upon the altar. <b>The priests actually eat the rest of this offering.</b> Ironically, <b>the more the people sinned, the more the priests had to eat</b>. Hosea points out that this later becomes a problem in <a title="Hosea 4 Summary" href="9-25.html#Adultery" target="_blank">Hosea 4:8 (see notes)</a>, &quot;They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.&quot;</p>
<p>These sacrifice specifications continue on into <a title="Leviticus 5 Summary" href="3-1.html#Top" target="_blank">Leviticus 5 (see notes)</a>.</p>
