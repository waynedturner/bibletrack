  <p><font size="2">5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
    6 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. <br>
    7 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean. <br>
    8 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering. <br>
    9 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together: <br>
    10 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites: <br>
    11 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for AN OFFERING OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, THAT THEY MAY EXECUTE THE SERVICE OF THE LORD. <br>
    12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites. <br>
    13 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD. <br>
    14 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine. <br>
    15 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for an offering. <br>
    16 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. <br>
    17 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. <br>
    18 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel. <br>
    19 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary. <br>
    20 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. <br>
    21 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them. <br>
    22 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them. <br>
    23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
    24 This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: <br>
    25 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more: <br>
    26 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it's time to consecrate the Levites. The first step was to get ceremonially sprinkled and then <b>shave them all over</b>. Yes, I said all over (verse 7). Verse 8 specifies the offerings to be made on behalf of these Levites at their consecration ceremony. Then we have a component of the ceremony still used today for consecration into Christian ministry, <b>the laying on of hands. </b>The whole congregation of Israel did so (verse 9). That's a lot of hand laying. Then the Levites lay their hands on the sacrifices to make atonement for themselves (verse 12). These Levites were consecrated to the Lord instead of the firstborn of all the Tribes (<a title="Numbers 3 Summary" href="7-13.html#Levites" target="_blank">I Chronicles 23:24-25, see notes</a>). In that passage it is expressly stated that he did so because the Levites no longer had to carry the dwelling and its furniture. This remained the standard.</p>
<p>We find the consecration service for the priests (Aaron and his sons) in <a title="Leviticus 8 Summary" href="3-3.html#Aaron" target="_blank">Leviticus 8 (see notes)</a>. Remember, not all Levites were priests - only Aaron's descendants. It is interesting to note that <strong>the priests were sprinkled with blood, but the Levites with water. </strong></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, <br>
          2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. <br>
          3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it. <br>
          4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. <br>
          5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. <br>
          6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: <br>
          7 And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel? <br>
          8 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you. <br>
          9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
          10 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD. <br>
          11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. <br>
          12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. <br>
          13 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. <br>
          14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land. </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now we come to the first anniversary mark of leaving Egypt (verse 1), and it's time to observe Passover. <font size="3">If you live in the camp, you must keep the Passover on the designated day.That is so, unless you were defiled in some way or out of town; then you observed it after the complication was rectified on the fourteenth day of the following month. <a title="Passover" href="9-24.html#Close" title="II Chronicles 30 Summary" target="_blank">II Chronicles 30 (see notes)</a>.</p>
        <p><font size="3">Here's that phrase &quot;even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people&quot; for those who declined to observe this special feast of Israel. In other words, <b>you observed it (Jew or not) or they kicked you out of the camp</b> - no freedom of religion there.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">It is interesting that this passage also includes the non-Jewish &quot;stranger&quot; in the Passover observance (verse 14). However, there was a particular stipulation for the stranger in <a title="Exodus 12 Summary" href="2-13.html#Passover" target="_blank">Exodus 12:48 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, <b>let all his males be circumcised</b>, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.&quot; To which the stranger might reply, &quot;No thanks; I had a big meal before I left home.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font size="3"><b>There's an interesting deduction that might be made regarding circumcision and Passover.</b> In the initial instructions given to the Hebrews regarding observance of Passover in <a title="Exodus 12 Summary" href="4-21.html#Circumcision" target="_blank"> Joshua 5:1-9 (see notes)</a>. In that passage Joshua is instructed to have a mass circumcision prior to entering Canaan. We are told in that passage that they did not circumcise for those 38 years of wilderness wandering. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that they did not observe Passover during that time either, because to do so would have been a violation of Exodus 12:48 along with these instructions in Numbers 9.</font></p>

May I emphasize again, the <b>Israelites were never lost</b>; God's presence was among them and instructed them exactly where to go and when to go there.

<p>How do you signal some two million or so people? You do so with these two silver trumpets - different sound patterns for different events (war, meetings, moving, etc.). Only the priests blew the trumpets (verse 8). You can imagine that blowing those trumpets must have been a much-envied responsibility. They also used these trumpets to signal new months and special festival days. The calendar during that period of time was based upon observation and not calculation. The priests declared the appropriate time for these events with the blowing of the big ol' silver trumpets. <a title="Jewish Calendar" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Jewish_calendar.html" target="_blank">For more information on the observational calendar see the information box to the right or click here.</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since Israel had been encamped at Mount Sinai (aka Mount Horeb) next to the homeland of Moses' wife's family in Midian, Hobab, his brother-in-law, had been living among them. He declined an offer to travel on into Canaan with them, but Moses makes an additional appeal to him. We're not told whether this second appeal is successful, but the &quot;Kenites&quot; (descendants of Hobab) are mentioned on numerous occasions in Judges, I and II Samuel and II Chronicles, indicating their presence among the Israelites. So, perhaps this second appeal by Moses was effective.</p>
<p>Moses had some standard words he used to signal time to travel and time to rest. Look at verses 35-36, &quot;And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and <b>let thine enemies be scattered</b>; and let them that hate thee flee before thee. And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.&quot; </p>
