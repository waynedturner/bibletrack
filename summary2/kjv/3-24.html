  <p><font size="2">8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever. <br>
    9 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons. <br>
    10 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee. <br>
    11 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it. <br>
    12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee. <br>
    13 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it. <br>
    14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. <br>
    15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. <br>
    16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. <br>
    17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD. <br>
    18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine. <br>
    19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee. <br>
    20 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. <br>
    21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. <br>
    22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die. <br>
    23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance. <br>
    24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. <br>
    25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
    26 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe. <br>
    27 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress. <br>
    28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD&rsquo;S heave offering to Aaron the priest. <br>
    29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. <br>
    30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. <br>
    31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation. <br>
    32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die. </font></p>

<p><b>When Korah, Dathan and Abiram tried to rebel against Moses, Moses was insistent that he had not lorded his position over them.</b> In particular, he had taken nothing from them, not &quot;so much as a donkey&quot; in <font size="3"><a title="Numbers 16 Summary" href="3-23.html#Democracy" target="_blank">Numbers 16:15 (see notes)</a></font>. The remaining verses of this chapter clearly establish that the <b>Levites will be supported by the rest of Israel with their tithes and other offerings.</b> Twelve tribes, 600,000 men, would maintain the support of some 22,000 Levite men and their families. The wording in this chapter may seem confusing as to whom exactly is being referenced here, Aaron and his sons or all of the Levites. This passage regards all the Levites as we see in verse 6, &quot;And I, behold, I have taken <b>your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD</b>, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.&quot; We get additional perspective on that from verses 20-21 where we see a transition in references from the &quot;priests&quot; to the &quot;Levites.&quot; In other words, <b>the Levites served as priest assistants.</b> These verses pertain to the provisions of the Levites as a whole.</p>
<p><b>The Levites are to be supported by the various offerings brought by the people. Included were: </b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Offerings (aka &quot;heave offerings&quot; in verse 8)<br>
		    Heave Offering: We first saw reference to &quot;heave&quot; offerings in <a href="3-21.html#Offering" title="Numbers 15 Summary" target="_blank">Numbers 15:20-21 (see notes)</a> were also heave offerings.<br>

			<li>Every wave offering (verses 11-13)<br>
			  Wave Offering: These were parts of peace-offerings, so called because they were waved by the priests.<br>

				<a title="Leviticus 27 Summary" href="3-12.html#Vows" target="_blank">See notes on redemption of vows in Leviticus 27.</a>
		</ul>
	<p>These arrangements formed a covenant of salt (verse 19), an indissoluble arrangement. &quot;All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.&quot; This &quot;covenant of salt&quot; is only referenced one other time in the Old Testament - <a title="II Chronicles 13 Summary" href="8-23.html#Rehoboam" target="_blank">II Chronicles 13:5 (see notes)</a>. It is apparently a reference to the preservation i.e. the permanence of a covenant.</p>
	<p>The support of the Levites is in view beginning in verse 20 through the end of the chapter. They are to be supported by the other tribes. Verses 21-24 specifically refer to the tithe in Israel. Other laws regarding tithing are found in <a href="4-10.html#Tithing" title="Deuteronomy 14 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 14:22&ndash;29 (see notes)</a>.</p>

		  <p><font size="2">1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, <br>
	      2 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke: <br>
	      3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face: <br>
	      4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times: <br>
	      5 And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: <br>
	      6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. <br>
	      7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. <br>
	      8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. <br>
	      9 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin. <br>
	      10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. <br>
	      11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days. <br>
	      12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. <br>
	      13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. <br>
	      14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. <br>
	      15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean. <br>
	      16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. <br>
	      17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: <br>
	      18 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: <br>
	      19 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even. <br>
	      20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. <br>
	      21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even. <br>
	      22 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even. </font></p>

		<p><font size="3">If this chapter was written directly upon the heels of the plague that killed 14,700 in <a title="Numbers 16 Summary" href="11-13.html#Perfection" target="_blank"><b>Hebrews 9:13</b>, see notes</a><b>).</b> This red-heifer ritual was probably conducted to ceremonially clean up in the aftermath of Korah's rebellion. Again, perhaps because of Korah's attempt to usurp priestly authority, notice who's performing the red-heifer ritual here, Aaron's son Eleazar; it's a family thing. Probably this is to clearly establish among the Israelites who they might expect to see as the next High Priest.</p>
	<p>Notice verse 2 says, &quot;bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:&quot; <b>These first 10 verses get frequent mention among Christian and Jewish scholars today. It is felt by many that a new temple built in Israel today must be purified just like this, with the ashes of a red heifer.</b> While we have many red heifers that fit the criteria here in America, it apparently happens very rarely in Israel that a red heifer is born. When it appears that one is born in Israel, many take this as a sign that the Messianic kingdom is right around the corner. <b>Perhaps the significance of this is taken out of context.</b> The real significance of the red heifer was to <b>use the ashes to ceremonially purify those who had contacted a dead body.</b> They could not come into contact with the Tabernacle without this cleansing. So, it would appear that <b>the object is the purification of the people, not the Tabernacle.</b></p>
		<p>As you can see in this chapter, purification after contact with a dead body was absolutely mandatory. To decline the ritual cleansing was to &quot;be cut off from among the congregation&quot; (verse  20). <b>Bring on the red heifer!</b></p>

  <p><font size="2">1 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. <br>
    2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. <br>
    3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD! <br>
    4 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? <br>
    5 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink. <br>
    6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them. <br>
    7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
    8 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. <br>
    9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. <br>
    10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? <br>
    11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also. <br>

<p><font size="3">We have <b>a whole new batch of adults </b>following Moses, and now and they're thirsty. They issue a long, detailed complaint to Moses which, again, calls into question his leadership abilities in verse 3-5. <b>Let's flashback</b> to the incident with their parents back 40 or so years earlier. I refer to <a title="Exodus 17 Summary" href="2-16.html#Thirsty" target="_blank">Exodus 17:3 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?&quot; You will recall that <b>God told Moses to strike the rock with his rod.</b> When he did, enough water for everyone gushed forth. <b>However, God is specific on this occasion to tell Moses to speak to the rock.</b> But in a fit of rage, <b>Moses smacks the rock with his rod instead of just speaking to the rock as God commanded.</b> He gets water, but some bad news from God as a result of his disobedience in verse 12, &quot;And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore <b>ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.&quot;</b> The Hebrew word here is plural so as to be correctly understood, &quot;Y'all shall not bring this congregation into the land,&quot; meaning Moses and Aaron. Don't feel too sorry for Moses; he is, after all, 120 years old at this point; Aaron is 123...and the last 40 years would have definitely been their most difficult. Later on in this chapter, Aaron dies.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">&quot;Meribah&quot; in verse 13 is a transliteration from the Hebrew word meaning &quot;to strive&quot; or &quot;to quarrel.&quot; The Hebrews did &quot;strive&quot; with Moses and Aaron on this occasion.</font></p>

		<p>The Edomites were the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother. Jacob was the father of Israel. Thinking that since Jacob and Esau had patched things up several hundred years ago, Moses sends messengers to the Edomites requesting peaceful passage through their land. Obviously they've revived their bitterness over that whole soup thing between Jacob and Esau (<a title="Genesis 25 Summary" href="1-27.html#Birthright" target="_blank">Genesis 25:27-34, see notes</a>). <b>Israel is headed up the east side of the Jordan from the Sinai Peninsula.</b> Through Edom is a shortcut to their destination, but <b>the Edomites refuse to let them pass through their land.</b> As a result, they head northeast to pass around Edom on their way to Canaan.

		<p><a name="Aaron"></a><font size="4"><b>Aaron dies a hero's death at the ripe old age of 123 (Numbers 20:22-29)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. <br>
	      23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying, <br>
	      24 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah. <br>
	      25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: <br>
	      26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there. <br>
	      27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. <br>
	      28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. <br>
	      29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
		<p>Here we have 8 verses detailing the death of Aaron and transference of his authority to his son, Eleazar. He is implicated in the anger-at-the-rock incident at Meribah along with Moses as the reason he must die, but he is 123 at the time. <b>The ritual accompanying his passing is a little strange.</b> And...verse 28 seems a little cold when it says, &quot;Moses stripped Aaron of his garments.&quot; Of course, if Aaron were to die in those fancy high-priest clothes, I guess they'd be defiled. He received a great ceremony; they officially mourned for 30 days after his death. We get a perspective of the time frame from <a title="Numbers 33 Summary" href="4-1.html#Where" target="_blank">Numbers 33:38-39 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the <b>fortieth year</b> after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the <b>first day of the fifth month</b>. And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.&quot; So...three go up into the mountain, and two come down - Moses and the new High Priest Eleazar. </p>
