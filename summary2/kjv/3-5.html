			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
    2 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest: <br>
    3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; <br>
    4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: <br>
    5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water: <br>
    6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water: <br>
    7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field. <br>
    8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days. <br>
    9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Any inexplicable chronic skin condition probably got the tag of leprosy back then. That's why <b>the priest had a procedure for determining whether or not the skin condition was contagious</b> in <a title="Leviticus 13 Summary" href="3-4.html#Leprosy" target="_blank">Leviticus 13 (see notes)</a>. Of course, if you were deemed to be contagious, then you were exported outside the camp to endure a very lonely existence. Whenever approached by anyone of good health,<b> the leper was required to cry out, &quot;unclean, unclean!&quot; </b>Once you were moved outside the camp with leprosy, it was generally felt that you wouldn't be back...ever! <b>But what if your leprosy went away?</b> Well, you didn't just walk back into camp and take up a normal lifestyle; there was an elaborate ceremony of sacrificing that had to be accomplished that <b>clearly marked the day</b> when you were pronounced leprosy free. That ceremony is found in this chapter. Understand this: The very-public ritual system was not for the purpose of cleansing the leprosy, but rather to formally declare that the one who was once declared to be a leper was now clean and in good standing among the congregation of Israel.</font></p>
<p><a name="Cleansing"></a><b>This formal cleansing ceremony for the leper was no casual affair. Take note of the steps involved over a seven-day period:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Two birds were required; one was killed as a symbol of purification and the other was released as a symbol of the man&#146;s newfound freedom (verses 4-7).
  <li>The former leper was to wash all over and shave off all of his hair (verses 8-9)
  </ul>
<p>Here's something worth noting. This is the only instance found in Mosaic Law in which purifying blood is applied to a human.</p>
<p><b>So, you're walking through the camp of Israel back in the wilderness days and you see a strange-looking man with no hair, no beard. WOW! He doesn't even have any eyebrows! Whoa! He's been shaved all over!</b> Oh...and despite his appearance, he seems really, really happy. What's his story? He's just been pronounced clean from leprosy and was required to shave his whole body. But he didn't mind; he's just happy to be alive and part of civilization again. However, there's still more he must do beginning on the eighth day.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">The newly-cleansed leper has more to do (Leviticus 14:10-20)</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. <br>
    11 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: <br>
    12 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: <br>
    13 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest&rsquo;s, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: <br>
    14 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot: <br>
    15 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: <br>
    16 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD: <br>
    17 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: <br>
    18 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest&rsquo;s hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD. <br>
    19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering: <br>
    20 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Beginning on the eighth day, four offerings must be made on behalf of the newly-cleansed leper - trespass, sin, burnt, and grain offerings. These offerings are explained in <a title="Leviticus offerings" href="http://www.bibletrack.com/notes/resource/misc/Sacrifices.html" target="_blank">Leviticus 1-7 (see notes)</a>.</font><font size="2"><br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">The newly-cleansed poor lepers catch a break (Leviticus 14:21-32)</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">21 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil; <br>
    22 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering. <br>
    23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD. <br>
    24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: <br>
    25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot: <br>
    26 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand: <br>
    27 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD: <br>
    28 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering: <br>
    29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest&rsquo;s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD. <br>
    30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get; <br>
    31 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD. <br>
    32 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who were too poor to provide a second lamb, they were permitted to provide two turtledoves or young pigeons for the second lamb to serve as sacrifices for the burnt offering and sin offering. However, no substitute was allowed for the trespass offering.</p>
<p>In <a title="Luke 5 Summary" href="1-25.html#Leprosy" target="_blank">Luke 5:12-15 (see notes)</a>, when Jesus healed the man with leprosy, he gave him specific instructions in Luke 5:14, &quot;And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.&quot; This modified procedure of appearing before a priest was apparently still a requirement of the Law in Jesus' day. The procedure for being declared clean was a lot of trouble, but I'm guessing the leper would have been willing to do this and much more just to be pronounced &quot;clean&quot; once again.</p>

		  <p><font size="2">33 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, <br>
	      34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; <br>
	      35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house: <br>
	      36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house: <br>
	      37 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall; <br>
	      38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days: <br>
	      39 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house; <br>
	      40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: <br>
	      41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place: <br>
	      42 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house. <br>
	      43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered; <br>
	      44 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean. <br>
	      45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. <br>
	      46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. <br>
	      47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. <br>
	      48 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. <br>
	      49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: <br>
	      50 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water: <br>
	      51 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times: <br>
	      52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet: <br>
	      53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean. <br>
	      54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall, <br>
	      55 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, <br>
	      56 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: <br>
	      57 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy. </font></p>

		<p>And then there's the &quot;house leprosy.&quot; <b>You gotta hate it when your house gets leprosy!</b> Actually, if you'll recall from <font size="3"><a title="Leviticus 13 Summary" href="3-4.html#Leprosy" target="_blank">Leviticus 13 (see notes)</a></font>, the Hebrew word (tsaw-rah&acute;-ath) translated &quot;leprosy&quot; (derived from the Greek word &quot;lepra&quot;) literally means &quot;a scaliness.&quot; So, it's really a general word for something growing on the surface that really shouldn't be; that can make you sick. Notice how in verse 37 it describes &quot;greenish&quot; or &quot;reddish&quot; hollow indentations in the wall - maybe some sort of a fungus? I think we can all agree - NASTY! <b>The house is unclean.</b> The procedure sort of reminds me of the asbestos removal procedures of the late twentieth century for buildings erected in the 1950's. We see in verse 41 that the house was to be &quot;scraped&quot; throughout. Literally, the visible surfaces were to be stripped. The scrapings were to be dumped outside the city in an &quot;unclean&quot; place before they put in new stone and mortar throughout the house. If that doesn't do it, verse 45 says that we just tear the house down; who wants a house with leprosy! So, the priest was also your building inspector and health inspector in Israel. I'm glad I'm not a priest!</p>
	<p>You'll notice that these procedures were to be applied to dwellings that they would one day occupy in Canaan (verse 34). Who knew it would be forty years before these regulations would be applicable? <b>Maybe the Canaanites don't mind living in those nasty houses, but the Hebrews are going to clean them up when they arrive.</b></p>
		<p>You will notice in verses 49-53 that the procedure for cleansing a house was the same as the first stage of the leprous person in Leviticus 14:4-7 (<a href="Cleansing">see above</a>); it required the priest to have at hand two birds, cedar wood, scarlet, hyssop, and earthen vessel and water.</p>

		<p>Leviticus 15 deals with some delicate issues. <a title="Numbers 5 Summary" href="3-16.html#Unclean" target="_blank">Numbers 5:1-4 (see notes)</a> gives some additional instructions regarding the terms of this separation during the period of uncleanness.  This chapter deals with some common, as well as uncommon, health issues.</p>
	<p><b>Note the following physiological issues that are dealt with in this chapter:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Verses 1-15 deal with some kind of disease, assumedly (by many Bible teachers) venereal disease. While the language in verses 1-15 is a little cryptic about this issue, this seems to be the correct understanding. It's obviously a reference to an abnormal discharge. This diagnosis seems to be supported by the content of the rest of the chapter. Sin and burnt offerings had to be made on behalf of these.			<li>Verses 16-18 deal with normal male discharges, thus lending to the assumptions made in verses 1-15. You will observe that sexual relations during the day rendered the couple unclean until evening. No offerings were required.
			<li>Verses 19-24 concern normal female menstrual discharges (no disposable modern conveniences available for women in those days). <b>One week of vacation each month - the Hebrew women had to be thinking, &quot;This is not so bad.&quot;</b> That's what I glean from verse 19, &quot;...she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.&quot; No offerings were required.	According	to	<a title="Numbers 5 Summary" href="3-16.html#Unclean" target="_blank">Numbers 5:1-4 (see notes)</a>, it would appear that these spent this week away from their homes outside the camp.
			<li>Verses 25-30 deal with female discharges that go beyond the normal length of time. Can you say, &quot;extended vacation?&quot; Sin and burnt offerings had to be made on behalf of these.		</ul>
