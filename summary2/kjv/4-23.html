    <p><strong>In this passage, we see the following in Jesus' ministry:</strong></p>
<ul>
          <li>Jesus had been ministering in Perea (beginning in <a href="4-11.html#Pharisees" title="John 10 Summary" target="_blank">John 10:40, see notes</a>).</li>
		  <li>Jesus returned to Bethany, about 1.5 miles from Jerusalem, to raise Lazarus in <a href="4-19.html#Lazarus" title="John 11 Summary" target="_blank">John 11 (see notes)</a>.</li>
		  <li>After Lazarus, Jesus and his disciples went north away from Jerusalem.</li>
		  <li>Those events took place at least a week or so before Jesus' crucifixion.<br>
	      This conjecture is based upon the fact that the next event recorded by John is in Bethany six days before Jesus' crucifixion in <a href="5-1.html#Supper" title="John 12 Summary" target="_blank">John 12 (see notes)</a>. </li>
          <li>In <a href="4-19.html#Lepers" title="Luke 17 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 17:11 (see notes)</a> we find that Jesus and his disciples had gone as far north as Samaria and Galilee, but now are returning to Jerusalem.<br>
Here in Matthew 19:1 and Mark 10:1 we see Jesus leaving the Galilee area and entering Judea.</li>

    <p>There's a key to understanding this passage in Matthew 19:3, &quot;The Pharisees also came unto him, <b>tempting him</b>, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his  wife <b>for every cause?</b>&quot; With regard to the law, Jewish history tells us that there were two different positions taught in Jesus' day by the Pharisees regarding <a title="Deuteronomy 24 Summary" href="4-14.html#Once" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 24:1-4 (see notes)</a> and specifically verse 1, &quot;When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and <b>it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her:</b> then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.&quot; </p>

            <div align="left">
              <p><font size="2">These were Jewish sages (rabbis) who had each established their own rival academies similar to our Harvard and Yale rivalry. On most issues of the law, these master teachers agreed. Their teachings are the basis for what we now know as the Talmud, the compilation of Jewish oral tradition into writing. Hillel was considered to be the more kind and gentle between the two. Shamai held a reputation of being harsh. Many Pharisees aligned themselves, with regard to the differences in teachings, with one of these rabbis or the other. With regard to divorce, it was Hillel who taught the greater latitude with regard to grounds for divorce. On the other hand, Shamai was very strict. Both positions were simply opinions based upon the Law of Moses, but they were, nonetheless, opinions that just happened to carry a lot of importance among Jewish scholars of the first century and afterward.</font></p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Among the Pharisees, two differing opinions about the legitimate grounds for divorce fell behind two prominent teachers (aka &quot;sages&quot; aka &quot;rabbis&quot;) who were contemporaries (or perhaps a little before) with Jesus' ministry, <b>Shammai and Hillel.</b> Shammai and his followers interpreted the expression to refer to gross indecency, though not necessarily adultery. Hillel extended the meaning beyond sin to all kinds of real or imagined offenses, including an improperly cooked meal. <b>The goal of the Pharisees in this discussion is to get Jesus to choose sides.</b>        </p>
    <p><b>&quot;So Jesus, who's right on this issue?&quot;</b> Jesus, the master teacher, points out, <b>&quot;Neither of you is correct!&quot; </b>In fact, he points out that the model for marriage is <a title="Genesis 2 Summary" href="3-8.html#Category" title="Levitcus 20 Summary" target="_blank">Leviticus 20:10 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And the man that committeth adultery with another man&#146;s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour&#146;s wife, the adulterer and <b>the adulteress shall surely be put to death.&quot;</b> Since the Law provided that adulterers were to be stoned to death, it's curious that the Old Testament Law would list this as grounds for divorce.<b> Given the choice between Deuteronomy 24:1 or Leviticus 20:10, which do you think an adulterous woman would choose?</b></p>
	<p>That causes us to consider that the justification for divorce in Deuteronomy 24:1 may have been  the woman's<b> sexual activity prior to marriage</b>, but only discovered afterwards. One such scenario is addressed in the Law of Moses as well in <a title="Deuteronomy 22 Summary" href="4-14.html#Once" target="_blank">See the notes on Deuteronomy 24:1-4 for this discussion.</a></p>
	<p><b>Jesus' final word on the issue takes a position that complies with neither of the contemporary teachings among the Pharisees.</b> His word in Matthew 19:9 seems to include as the only grounds for putting away one's wife through divorce her &quot;fornication,&quot; a term more general than &quot;adultery&quot; that encompasses all kinds of sexual indiscretions. In other words, the Greek word for adultery, &quot;moicheia,&quot; is a subset of the Greek word for fornication, &quot;porneia.&quot; It is important to note here that Jesus had not gathered his disciples around to comprehensively teach them about grounds for divorce. <b>Matthew 19:3 tells us that his brief comments on the issue were in response to a trick question by the Pharisees.</b> That's evidenced by the fact that the doctrinal aspect of this discourse is obviously abbreviated. </p>
		<p>In comparing these two passages, let's look more closely at the sequence of events on this discussion. It would appear that Jesus' word on this issue was given to the Pharisees in Matthew 19:8-9, but only to his disciples a second time after the confrontation with the Pharisees in Mark 10:10-12. In the private gathering away from the Pharisees recorded in Mark's account, Jesus does not even include the phrase &quot;except for fornication&quot; recorded by Matthew in verse 19:9.<b> The object of Jesus' words here being recorded is obviously to expose the inconsistencies of the Pharisees in their application of the Law of Moses.</b></p>

		<p>In this short passage, Jesus points out that the <b>Kingdom of God will come as people respond to Jesus as little children</b> when he says, &quot;...for of such is the kingdom of God.&quot; <b>The Jews in Jesus' day were thinking that the Kingdom of God would be established by warfare against Rome</b>, not with the attitudes of children. It is important to understand what is in view here. The &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; here is a reference to the Old Testament prophecy that the Messiah would establish the rule of King David over the entire earth. Many like to use this passage to prove the salvation of small children. I don't find that teaching here, although suggestions are made here regarding the innocence of children. <b><a title="Salvation of small children summary" href="3-22.html#Children" target="_blank">If you are interested in knowing what the Bible says about the salvation of small children, click here.</a></b></p>

<p><b>When taken out of context, this is a very confusing passage.</b> The greatest confusion arises out of the actual question asked by the rich young ruler, &quot;...what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?&quot; <b>His question, per se, misses the point of Jesus' teaching on the Kingdom of God with regard to children in the preceding verses and the subsequent teaching on the Kingdom of God/Heaven that follows his question.</b> Remember, <b>the Pharisees felt that their religious standing would merit a place of prominence in the newly-established Kingdom of God</b> on earth under the Messiah when established. Throughout this passage, the Messianic kingdom on earth is in view - not Heaven itself. That's what the Jews in that day were looking forward to. This obviously is the back drop behind this question from the rich young ruler as well. <b>Being rich, it makes sense to him that a law-abiding rich guy should fit nicely into the framework of this Kingdom of God which he equates with eternal life.</b> Jesus' reply is similar to his other calls for discipleship. <a title="Discipleship Summary" href="4-11.html#Discipleship" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a>. So you see, you do not need to take a vow of poverty to be saved. </p>
<p><b>It is interesting to note here that this man professes to have kept all the commandments from his &quot;youth up,&quot; including &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&quot;</b> If that is truly the case, giving his wealth to the poor shouldn't require a second thought. Hey! That's not one of the ten commandments anyway! No, but it is clearly stated in <a title="Leviticus 19 Summary" href="11-21.html#Refrain" target="_blank">James 2:8 (see notes)</a>. It's the essence of the commandments that deal with one's relationship with others. Let's face it; it's an ideal, but <b>who truly fulfills the essence of this commandment except for Jesus himself.</b> Obviously, this is a prideful man that comes to Jesus with an impressive resume, only to find that his personal accomplishments have no eternal implications. </p>
		<p>Another aspect of Jesus' exchange with this man is the fact that Jesus had special insight into this man's thinking as he did in <a title="John 2 Summary" href="1-17.html#Temple" target="_blank">John 2:24 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because <b>he knew all men,</b>&quot; Jesus knew what was the man's motivation in asking his questions and literally what was in his heart. That probably accounts for the harsh treatment by Jesus. It is not reasonable to assume that Jesus issues a special condition for salvation to this man unlike those required of anyone else. There obviously was a deeper issue on the stage here. Subsequently, notice the comments from his disciples in the next passage demonstrating what they had gleaned from Jesus' conversation with this &quot;rich young ruler.&quot; <strong>It would appear, therefore, that his intent is to buy his way into a prominent ruling position in the newly-founded kingdom. </strong>That being the case, the conversation between Jesus and himself was not really about going to Heaven after all.</p>

		<p>The disciples understand the teaching of Jesus in the preceding verses to be about ruling. It is obvious from their question, and Jesus addresses their question accordingly. <b>He deals with a ruling structure in the Messianic rule on earth. </b>He uses the term &quot;world to come&quot; in Luke 18:30. The Greek word for &quot;world&quot; here is different from several other occurrences in the King James Version. Here the word is &quot;aion&quot; (translated various ways) instead of &quot;cosmos&quot; (always translated &quot;world&quot; except in I Peter 3:3 where it is translated &quot;adorning&quot;). &quot;Cosmos&quot; means &quot;orderly arrangement&quot; from which our English word &quot;cosmetics&quot; comes. &quot;Aion&quot; is translated a number of ways including &quot;world,&quot; but holds the context of a period of time (or eternity) rather than a place. Jesus is making reference to an &quot;age&quot; to come i.e. the Kingdom of God on earth. Matthew's account drives this message home when he notes that Jesus included this promise to his disciples in verse 28 &quot;ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&quot; That takes place on earth during the millennium and in the New Jerusalem after that. It's not a Heaven thing at all! It is interesting that this passage only accommodates 12 Apostles. Many discussions take place in theological circles regarding who should be considered the twelfth Apostle, Matthias or Paul. <a title="Acts 1 Summary" href="7-4.html#Successor" target="_blank">For greater insight on this issue, see the notes on Acts 1:12-26 by clicking here.</a></p>
	<p>Matthew 19 ends with verse 30 where Jesus says, &quot;But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.&quot; There he's addressing the issue of man-contrived impressions with regard to whom is most deserving to enter the Kingdom of God (verses 24-25). As stated in the previous section, these Pharisees felt that their religious standing should merit a place of prominence in the newly-established Kingdom of God on earth under the Messiah when established. Jesus continues this discussion into <a title="Matthew 20 Summary" href="4-27.html#Fair" target="_blank">Matthew 20 (see notes)</a>.</p>
