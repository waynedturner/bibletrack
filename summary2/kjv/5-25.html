<p><font size="3">Luke just records that Jesus preached in the temple each day during the gathering in Jerusalem for the passover. John specifies that Jesus preached the prerequisite to eternal life - believing on Jesus, trusting Jesus as Savior. He makes the contrast between abiding in light and darkness and then issues a stern warning regarding judgment on those who reject Jesus as Savior. There&#39;s a solemn warning applicable to all in John 12:48, &quot;He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.&quot; We will all be judged by the message of Jesus. Just a few hours later, Jesus would make this statement in John 14:6, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot; These two verses stand on their own without commentary: <b>The only way to God is through Jesus Christ.</b> God has not provided an alternate means of salvation - just Jesus as Savior.</font></p>

<p>The Jewish leaders were unable to locate Jesus except for the times when crowds were gathered around him. They seemed to always lose respect in the eyes of the Jewish masses as a result of the confrontations they had with Jesus on those occasions.<b> They were just not mentally equipped for those verbal duels with the Son of God. </b>Now, not wanting to go head to head with Jesus in front of a Passover crowd, <b>they conspire to attempt his capture after the crowds are cleared out of Jerusalem</b> (they were afraid of the common people)<b>. </b>Matthew and Mark both use the same Greek word (&quot;dolos&quot;) to describe the proposed method for capturing and killing Jesus - <b>TRICKERY</b> aka &quot;subtilty&quot; (Matthew 26:4,KJV) aka &quot;craft&quot; (Mark 14:1,KJV).</p>

<p>So, here&#39;s the dilemma for these Jewish leaders. Who can we find to lead us to Jesus at a time when he is not surrounded by crowds of adoring Jews? We&#39;ll find our culprit later on in these three chapters - Judas Iscariot.</p>

<p><a name="House"></a><font size="4"><b>Supper at a leper&#39;s house (Matthew 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9)</b></font><br />
<a href="5-1.html#Supper" target="_blank" title="John 12:1-11 Summary">The detailed notes on these passages may be found in the May 1 reading which includes John 12:1-11; click here.</a><br />
Matthew and Mark have just made reference to the time in Matthew 26:2 and Mark 14:1 as being two days before the passover. While they continue their narratives into this passage, neither Matthew nor Mark declare when the supper at Simon the leper&#39;s house actually took place. In fact, we know from John 12:1 that the supper was held in Bethany four days prior to this &quot;six days before the passover.&quot; It must be concluded, therefore, that the Matthew and Mark accounts are not following this event sequentially. All three passages regarding the event are shown below, but the detailed notes may be found in the section where we sequentially dealt with <a href="5-1.html#Supper" target="_blank" title="John 12 Summary">John 12:1-11 (see notes)</a>.</p>

<p>There had been a concern among the Jewish leadership regarding the reaction of the people to capturing Jesus. <b>Judas provides a solution when he goes to the Jewish leaders and offers to take them to Jesus away from the multitudes so that he can be taken prisoner quietly.</b> Luke 22:6 says, &quot;And he promised, and <b>sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.</b>&quot; This is great news to the Jewish leaders. With this betrayal, they can keep the whole issue out of the news; at least that&#39;s what they thought. For those who may think that Judas somehow made his decision on some ill-conceived noble principles, think again. Look at Matthew&#39;s account in verse 15 where Judas says to the Jewish leaders, &quot;What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you?&quot; <b>The only principle seen here is GREED!</b></p>

15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.<br />
16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.<br />
17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.<br />
18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.<br />
19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.<br />
20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">It&#39;s after the passover supper when Jesus does something that obviously surprises the disciples - well Peter anyway; he washes their feet.<b> It&#39;s interesting that Matthew, Mark and Luke record the institution of the Lord&#39;s supper after the passover meal, but John does not.</b> Instead, John records the event that follows afterward (foot washing), and the other three gospel authors do not. Peter finds this foot-washing ritual very unsettling. There&#39;s obviously no question here in his mind regarding the lordship of Jesus. In typical Peter style, he thinks it not appropriate for Jesus to wash his feet. On the other hand, there&#39;s Judas. We saw in this passage (verse 2) that he has already determined to betray Jesus. It is significant to note that Jesus is promoting the demonstration of humility among the disciples with this act as he says in verse 14, &quot;If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet.&quot; <b>This act takes on perspective when we recognize that the conversation about who&#39;s the greatest in Luke 22:24-30 </b>(<a href="#Greatest">see below</a>)<b> takes place at the same time. By recognizing that these two events are tied together, we see that this served as a unique lesson on humility for the disciples at that time and is not an act intended to be observed down through the ages as an ordinance like baptism and communion.</b> Both baptism and communion commemorate Jesus&#39; sacrifice (our relationship to our Lord), while the washing of feet on this occasion was for the purpose of teaching a lesson on authority to the disciples.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It occurs to me that the foot-washing episode six days earlier must have been looming in the disciples&#39; minds as this event was taking place (<a href="#House">see notes above</a>).</font></p>

<p>John&#39;s gospel gives the most detail here. Jesus proclaims to the twelve that one of them will betray him. They begin to ask among themselves who this should be. <b>Jesus clearly identifies Judas in John&#39;s gospel by giving him the word right there at the supper table.</b> This identification apparently isn&#39;t completely clear to the other disciples when Jesus sends Judas away to go about his betrayal business. We know this from John 13:28-29.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the identification of one of the disciples in verse 23, &quot;one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved,&quot; is a reference to John himself - the one who wrote this Gospel. He is clearly identified in <a href="6-30.html#John" target="_blank" title="John 21 Summary">John 21:20-25 (see notes)</a>.</p>

<p>John 13:34-35 are foundational verses for several exhortations in the epistles regarding the attitude of Believers toward one another. Notice what Jesus says here on this subject, &quot;A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. <b>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.&quot;</b> Simply put, <b>Believers are to be known by the fact that they demonstrate love toward other Believers.</b></p>

<p>Here&#39;s where our ordinance began. All three synoptic gospels detail the event that followed their passover meal. However, <b>only Luke includes the words of Jesus in verse 19, &quot;...this do in remembrance of me.&quot;</b> Paul further adds support to the continual observance of communion by believers when he says in <a href="9-6.html#Ordinance" target="_blank" title="I Corinthians 11 Summary">I Corinthians 11:26 (see notes)</a>,<b> &quot;For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord&rsquo;s death till he come.&quot;</b> While no interval between observances is specified, it appears that the disciples in the Book of Acts observed communion on a weekly basis, and perhaps each time they met; this seems to be indicated in <a href="7-28.html#Guy" target="_blank" title="Acts 20 Summary">Acts 20:7 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.&quot; However, there is no correct interval mandated for the observance of this ordinance.</p>

<p>Jesus declares that the bread is a picture of his body and the drink a picture of his &quot;shed&quot; blood; all three accounts make this point very clearly. Jesus makes a very clear statement regarding the covenant represented by this action - the &quot;new testament.&quot; The Greek word for &quot;testament&quot; here is &quot;diatheke&quot; and is interchangeably translated &quot;covenant&quot; in the New Testament. It is important to recognize that the old covenant is the Mosaic Law; the new covenant is salvation by grace through the shed blood of Jesus Christ. Christians today get confused when they fail to differentiate the two.</p>

<p>Matthew (verse 30) and Mark (verse 26) report that this first communion was concluded with the singing of a hymn. It is likely that this was the singing of one of the songs found between <a href="7-17.html#Psalms" target="_blank" title="Psalms 113-118 Summary">Psalms 113-118 (see notes)</a>. Jewish tradition tells us that these were songs that were sung as part of the Passover celebration.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Greatest"></a>Who&#39;s the greatest? (Luke 22:21-30)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">21 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.<br />
22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!<br />
23 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.<br />
24 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.<br />
25 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.<br />
26 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.<br />
27 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.<br />
28 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.<br />
29 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;<br />
30 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">As the disciples are there talking about the identity of the betrayer, they wander into a discussion about who&#39;s the greatest among them. John doesn&#39;t record this discussion, but it is interesting that the foot-washing ceremony happens at the same sitting. It is logical to assume that Jesus&#39; words, &quot;ye also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet,&quot; are spoken to emphasize the servant component rather than the leadership component of being one of Jesus&#39; disciples.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One more aspect of this is interesting. <b>John doesn&#39;t record the &quot;who&#39;s the greatest&quot; discussion, but he does record the foot washing which, I believe, is related.</b> John also doesn&#39;t record another incident which took place some time back as was recorded in <a href="4-27.html#Agent" target="_blank" title="Matthew 20, Mark 10 Summary">Matthew 20:20-28 and Mark 10:35-45 (see notes)</a>. On that occasion it was John himself and his brother, James, who sought some guarantees about their future place in the coming kingdom. They even used their mama as their agent on that occasion. Jesus used that occasion to emphasize &quot;serving&quot; as the essential quality of a disciple back then as well. Incidentally, on that occasion the other disciples were &quot;moved with indignation against the two brethren.&quot;</font></p>

<p>This competition for ruling supremacy among the twelve had a basis in Jesus&#39; previous teaching. Jesus said in <a href="4-23.html#Reward" target="_blank" title="Matthew 19 Summary">Matthew 19:28 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&quot; But wait! There&#39;s more. We see the New Jerusalem which is established in Revelation 21. Look at <a href="12-31.html#Jerusalem" target="_blank" title="Revelation 21 Summary">Revelation 21:14 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&quot; <strong>So, who gets to be the big man among the twelve? Well...Jesus...of course.</strong></p>
