		<p>Matthew gives some detail regarding the earthquake that had moved the stone away from the opening of the sepulchre and the reaction of the &quot;keepers&quot; when it happened. It's after daybreak on Sunday morning, and the tomb is open. While John just mentions Mary Magdalene in his account, Matthew and Mark mention that Mary (Jesus' aunt) was there also. But Luke reports down in verse 24:10 that there were other women present at the tomb site as well.</p>

<p>Only John includes this. Before actually entering the tomb herself, Mary Magdalene runs to get Peter and John. &quot;The other disciple&quot; (verse 8) is the modest way by which John refers to himself in his gospel (along with the not-so-modest &quot;disciple, whom Jesus loved&quot; in verse 2). It's mildly amusing to me that John wants us to know that he's in better physical condition than Peter - beats him to the tomb. Yup, it's empty all right. The grave clothes are there, but Jesus has checked out.</p>
<p>Up to this point, Jesus has not appeared after his resurrection. Peter and John see evidence of his resurrection, and the Marys have not yet entered into the tomb.</p>

	<p>After her conversation with the two angels, Mary Magdalene gets another surprise. When she turns around, there's Jesus. Not until after a brief conversation does she recognize that she's talking with Jesus. He does instruct her not to touch him at this point because he has not yet ascended to Heaven. The KJV translates the Greek &quot;aptou&quot; as &quot;touch&quot; while the NKJV translates it as &quot;cling to&quot; here in verse 17. For those who are convinced that the exact word here is important, I quote the renown Greek scholar of the late 19th/early 20th century, A. T. Robertson, when he says in his definitive work entitled &quot;Word Pictures in the New Testament&quot; the following: &quot;Present middle imperative in prohibition with genitive case, meaning 'cease clinging to me' rather than 'Do not touch me.'&quot; Specifically, Jesus had resurrected from &quot;the heart of the earth&quot; (Matthew 12:40, see notes), but had not yet ascended to Heaven. This brings up an interesting discussion when coupled with some other New Testament passages.</p>

<ul>
			<li>Ephesians 4:8-10 - Paul takes a little doctrinal detour when he quotes Psalms 68:18 regarding the whereabouts of Christ between the crucifixion and resurrection. He says that Jesus led &quot;captivity captive&quot; or literally &quot;a band of captives&quot; from the lower part of the earth to a place &quot;far above all Heavens&quot; at his resurrection.			<li>Matthew 12:40 - Jesus said he would spend three days AND three night in the heart of the earth (location of hades).			<li>Luke 16:19-31 - Jesus identifies a place called &quot;Abraham's bosom&quot; within eyesight of a place of torment separated by a great gulf.			<li>Luke 23:43 - Jesus tells the thief that got saved that &quot;today&quot; he would join him in &quot;paradise.&quot;			<li>I Peter 3:19 - Jesus preached to the &quot;spirits in prison.&quot;			<li>John 20:17 - Jesus tells Mary not to touch him because he has not yet ascended to &quot;my Father.&quot;			<li>Matthew 27:52-54 - After the resurrection of Jesus, some resurrected saints wander into Jerusalem and appear to many.		</ul>
		<p>Based on these scriptures, it is logical to conclude that the folks saved prior to the resurrection were being held in Hades where Christ showed up after his crucifixion and preached to the inhabitants there. After three days he led &quot;captivity captive&quot; i.e. &quot;a band of captives&quot; i.e. the saved-prior-to-the-resurrection folks to Heaven with a stop on earth to visit Mary (but she's not to touch him), at which time some of these traveling-to-Heaven saints wandered into Jerusalem. The next time he appears, it's ok to touch him. <a title="Ephesians 4:1-16 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Paradise.html" target="_blank"><b title="Paradise Relocated">For a complete discussion on the passages listed above, click here to see the article entitled &quot;Paradise Relocated.&quot;</b></a></p>

<p>Luke reports in verse 10 that there are several women who go back to report their findings to the disciples. You mean they thought the women were making this stuff up? Yup - afraid so! Luke reports that Peter went to the tomb to see what the fuss was all about - apparently his second trip of the day, but this time without John. However, even after this second trip, he apparently isn't certain what it all means.</p>
<p>The evidence of their unbelief (verse 11) is the fact that they did not pack up and head for Galilee as they were instructed to do in Mark 16:7 and again in 10. We see in <a href="6-30.html#Jesus" title="Mark 16 Summary" target="_blank">Mark 16:14 (see notes)</a> that Jesus finally has to go to them in Jerusalem where they were gathered.</p>

<p>Matthew gives us a little bit of insight into another issue regarding the resurrection of Jesus. The guards at the tomb are in a little bit of a predicament here; <b>they've lost the body.</b> When you're primary function is to guard something, and you lose it, that's serious. Apparently these were Temple guards - not Roman guards, according to <a href="6-22.html#Careful" title="Matthew 28:65 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 27:65 (see notes)</a>. That's why they report back to the Jewish leaders for a what-do-we-do-now meeting. Solution: if they will say that they took a snooze at which time the disciples came and stole the body, the Jewish leaders will (1) pay them a bribe for lying and (2) cover for them with the Roman authorities if they are asked. &quot;What a deal!&quot; the guards must have thought, &quot;We don't have to die after all!&quot; Plus, they had a little extra spending money. Matthew wants us to know that this bribe is common knowledge among the Jews (verse 15).</p>

17   And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?<br>
18   And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?<br>
19   And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:<br>
20   And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.<br>
21   But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.<br>
22   Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;<br>
23   And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.<br>
24   And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.<br>
25   Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:<br>
26   Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?<br>
27   And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<br>
28   And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.<br>
29   But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.<br>
30   And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<br>
31   And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.<br>
32   And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?<br>
33   And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,<br>
34   Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.<br>
35   And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</font></td>

	<p><strong>Luke covers this account exhaustively.</strong> He records the teaching session by Jesus for these two men (disciples, but not of the eleven). The initial encounter is on the road to Emmaus, a city about six or so miles away from Jerusalem. We see in Luke 24:33 that these two men went back to Jerusalem to report everything that had been told to them by Jesus to the eleven apostles. This appearance takes place on resurrection Sunday as well as the report back to the eleven. It would appear that these two disciples (one was named Cleopas, about whom we know nothing) did not know with whom they were enjoying fellowship until they broke bread with Jesus in verse Luke 24:30. At that point, they realized that they were communing with Jesus.</p>
	<p>One verse in this passage might be easily overlooked with regard to its doctrinal value, Luke 24:27, &quot;And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.&quot; The phrase &quot;beginning with Moses&quot; is particularly significant inasmuch as it is difficult to readily identify which quotation from Moses looks forward to the Messiah. However, it was apparently common knowledge among the Jews in Jesus' day that <a href="4-12.html#Prophet" title="Deuteronomy 18 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 18:15-22 (see notes)</a> was a reference to the anticipated Messiah by Moses himself.

	<p><font color="#cce1ff">.</font>There's one more significant fact that should be emphasized once again here. The two Marys had been instructed in Mark 16:7 (<a href="6-30.html#Jesus" title="Mark 16 Summary" target="_blank">Mark 16:14 (see notes)</a>.</p>
