<p><em>A review of where the Levites lived within the Tribes of Israel </em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">54 Now these are their dwelling places throughout their castles in their coasts, of the sons of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites: for theirs was the lot. <br>
    55 And they gave them Hebron in the land of Judah, and the suburbs thereof round about it. <br>
    56 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh. <br>
    57 And to the sons of Aaron they gave the cities of Judah, namely, Hebron, the city of refuge, and Libnah with her suburbs, and Jattir, and Eshtemoa, with their suburbs, <br>
    58 And Hilen with her suburbs, Debir with her suburbs, <br>
    59 And Ashan with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs: <br>
    60 And out of the tribe of Benjamin; Geba with her suburbs, and Alemeth with her suburbs, and Anathoth with her suburbs. All their cities throughout their families were thirteen cities. <br>
    61 And unto the sons of Kohath, which were left of the family of that tribe, were cities given out of the half tribe, namely, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, by lot, ten cities. <br>
    62 And to the sons of Gershom throughout their families out of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities. <br>
    63 Unto the sons of Merari were given by lot, throughout their families, out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities. <br>
    64 And the children of Israel gave to the Levites these cities with their suburbs. <br>
    65 And they gave by lot out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, and out of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, these cities, which are called by their names. <br>
    66 And the residue of the families of the sons of Kohath had cities of their coasts out of the tribe of Ephraim. <br>
    67 And they gave unto them, of the cities of refuge, Shechem in mount Ephraim with her suburbs; they gave also Gezer with her suburbs, <br>
    68 And Jokmeam with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs, <br>
    69 And Aijalon with her suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs: <br>
    70 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh; Aner with her suburbs, and Bileam with her suburbs, for the family of the remnant of the sons of Kohath. <br>
    71 Unto the sons of Gershom were given out of the family of the half tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, and Ashtaroth with her suburbs: <br>
    72 And out of the tribe of Issachar; Kedesh with her suburbs, Daberath with her suburbs, <br>
    73 And Ramoth with her suburbs, and Anem with her suburbs: <br>
    74 And out of the tribe of Asher; Mashal with her suburbs, and Abdon with her suburbs, <br>

    76 And out of the tribe of Naphtali; Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, and Hammon with her suburbs, and Kirjathaim with her suburbs. <br>
    77 Unto the rest of the children of Merari were given out of the tribe of Zebulun, Rimmon with her suburbs, Tabor with her suburbs: <br>
    78 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho, on the east side of Jordan, were given them out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer in the wilderness with her suburbs, and Jahzah with her suburbs, <br>
    79 Kedemoth also with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs: <br>

<p>Notice verses 31-46. David appointed Levites to serve as music directors. We are told by historians that it was typical in the ancient world for the various religions to have an entire order of musicians dedicated to worship. It's noteworthy that worship has traditionally been accompanied by music. David himself appointed an entire music team to head up this aspect of worship. The three leading musicians Heman, Asaph and Ethan were appointed, one from each of the Levite families (33, 39, 44).</p>
<p><a name="Zadok"></a><b>We also notice in this chapter that not all Levites were created equal. Those who were descendants of Aaron were authorized to offer sacrifices, but the rest were in charge of other tabernacle and temple duties.</b> The genealogy for the priests in verses 3-15 goes from Aaron through Eleazar all the way down to the return of the exiles; this genealogy does not include the priests from Aaron's other son, Ithamar. As a matter of fact, Eli (priest during the first four chapters of I Samuel) was a descendant of Ithamar, and so was Ahimelech and his son Abiathar during the reigns of Saul and David. In David's day, the high priest was a man named <b>Zadok</b> (listed here in 8 and 53) along with Abiathar. Abiathar continued on into Solomon's rule until he was removed by Solomon in<a title="I Kings 2 Summary" href="3-27.html#Women" target="_blank">Numbers 25:12-13 (see notes)</a>, future priests should all come only from the line of Phinehas and not Ithamar. Obviously, it took a few generations for this to become reality, but was finally set in order with the end of Abiathar's priesthood by Solomon. You will notice that the high priesthood of Eli through Abiathar are not recognized in this genealogical record.</p>
		<p>It makes sense, therefore, that only the line of Aaron through Eleazar is listed here in this genealogy of priests. <b>All high priests of Israel from Zadok forward claimed to be his descendant.</b> In New Testament times, the Sadducees served as the priestly class. &quot;Sadducee&quot; is a word that is believed to be derived from &quot;Zadok.&quot; That fits what we know of New Testament history; the high priests claimed to be descendants of Zadok, and therefore all the high priests were Sadducees. It's ironic that the Sadducees of the New Testament had a common trait: they did not believe in the supernatural including life after death, resurrection of the dead, etc.</p>
		<p>Beginning in verse 54 through the end of the chapter we have a listing of the 48 cities occupied by the Levites, a repeat of <a title="Joshua 21 Summary" href="4-26.html#Levites" target="_blank">Joshua 21 (see notes)</a>.</p>
