    <p><font size="4"><b>Meanwhile...back to the genealogies...<br>
				</b></font><font size="3">It's quite important to understand the purpose of Chronicles. The exiles began leaving Judah in 605 B.C. When the exiles returned to their land after 535 B.C., the author of Chronicles sought to give the returning exiles a perspective on their history and heritage. He therefore summed up and restated the essentials of the historical books that had preceded them. Isn't it interesting that Jews in the first century A.D. could trace their ancestors back four thousand years, while I can only trace mine back 250 years?</font></p>

    2 Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims. <br>
    3 And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh; <br>
    4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah. <br>
    5 And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons. <br>
    6 And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six hundred and ninety. <br>

    9 And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers. <br>
    10 And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin, <br>
    11 And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God; <br>
    12 And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer; <br>
    13 And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God. <br>
    14 And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari; <br>
    15 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph; <br>
    16 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites. <br>
    17 And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief; <br>
    18 Who hitherto waited in the king&rsquo;s gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi. <br>
    19 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry. <br>
    20 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him. <br>
    21 AND ZECHARIAH THE SON OF MESHELEMIAH WAS porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <br>
    22 All these WHICH WERE CHOSEN TO BE PORTERS IN THE GATES WERE two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office. <br>
    23 So they and their children HAD THE OVERSIGHT OF THE GATES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards. <br>
    24 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south. <br>
    25 And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them. <br>
    26 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. <br>
    27 And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them. <br>
    28 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale. <br>
    29 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices. <br>
    30 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices. <br>
    31 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans. <br>
    32 And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath. <br>
    33 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night. <br>
    34 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem. <br>

<p>These verses reproduce the lines of Benjamin living near Jerusalem (verse 38). It basically repeats 8:29-38 (<a href="#Genealogy">see above</a>) on the family of Saul; but its purpose here is to introduce the tragic end to his reign found in chapter 10.</p>
<p><a name="Review"></a><font size="4"><b>Now for a review on Saul's death (I Chronicles 10)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. <br>
    2 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. <br>
    3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers. <br>
    4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. <br>
    5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died. <br>
    6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together. <br>
    7 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. <br>
    8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa. <br>
    9 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people. <br>
    10 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. <br>
    11 And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, <br>
    12 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. <br>
    13 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it; <br>
    14 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a repeat of the story found in <a title="I Samuel 31 Summary" href="5-26.html#Saul" target="_blank">I Samuel 31 (see notes)</a> regarding the death of Saul. The rest of I Chronicles deals entirely with the reign of David down to his death in the last chapter of I Chronicles. Sometimes life isn't fair - they both reigned 40 years, but David gets 19 chapters while Saul gets 1. Not only so, Saul's chapter just deals with his death.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, however, that <b>the reason for the termination of the throne of Saul is found in verses 13-14 here</b>, &quot;So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it; And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.&quot; So, Saul's kingdom was terminated because of his disobedience to God in <a title="I Samuel 15 Summary" href="5-26.html#Witch" target="_blank">I Samuel 28, see notes)</a></p>
		<p>Interestingly enough, the incident of <a title="I Samuel 13 Summary" href="5-15.html#Saul" target="_blank">I Samuel 13:8-14 (see notes)</a> is not mentioned per se. Note I Samuel 13:13-14, &quot;And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: <b>for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</b> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.&quot; Upon close inspection of Samuel's words here, the punishment for disobedience seems to be that Saul's kingdom will not continue through his descendants. Had it been that Saul had practiced obedience to the Lord as David did, Jews today would be looking for the establishment of the throne of Saul rather than the throne of David.</p>
