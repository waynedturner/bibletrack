	<p><font size="4"><b>LORD, my heart is not haughty (Psalm 131)<br>
	</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">A Song of degrees of David. <br>
    1 LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. <br>
    2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. <br>
    3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Here's
  a very short Psalm written by David. The introduction to this Psalm
  says Song of Degrees. Here's the entry from Easton's Bible Dictionary
  regarding the meaning of this introduction:</font></p>
<blockquote>
			<p><font size="3"><b>Song of Degrees:</b>
song of steps, a title given to each of these fifteen psalms, 120&#8211;134
inclusive. The probable origin of this name is the circumstance that
these psalms came to be sung by the people on the ascents or goings up
to Jerusalem to attend the three great festivals (Deut. 16:16). They
were well fitted for being sung by the way from their peculiar form,
and from the sentiments they express. &#8220;They are characterized by
brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora [i.e., repetition], and by their
epigrammatic style...More than half of them are cheerful, and all of
them hopeful.&#8221; They are sometimes called &#8220;Pilgrim Songs.&#8221; Four of them
were written by David, one (127) by Solomon, and the rest are anonymous.</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><font size="3">David
uses an interesting simile here in these verses. He is content in the
Lord just as a recently-fed baby in the presence of his mother - no
fretting over sustenance - just contented fellowship.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>A Psalm of thanks (Psalm 138)<br>
	</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">A Psalm of David. <br>
	      1 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. <br>
	      2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. <br>
	      3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. <br>
	      4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth. <br>
	      5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD. <br>
	      6 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off. <br>
	      7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. <br>
	      8 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
		<p>You
		  will notice in this Psalm of David a declaration of thanks, his reasons
		  for thanks, a call to praise, and his expression of confidence in God.
		  David was surrounded by nations that were polytheistic. He proclaims in
		  verse 1, "I will praise thee with my whole heart: <b>before the gods</b> will I sing praise unto thee." He makes it clear that he'll not
		  compromise the worship of the true God for political correctness. As a
		  matter of fact, his world view is almost prophetic when he asserts in verse 4,
  "<b>All the kings of the earth shall praise thee</b>, O LORD, when they
		  hear the words of thy mouth." He's convinced that there's coming a day
		  when they'll acknowledge the one true God as well. That gives this
		  Psalm a little of that Messianic Kingdom flavor.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>A personal relationship with God (Psalm 139)<br>
	</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. <br>
    1 O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me. <br>
    2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. <br>
    3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. <br>
    4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. <br>
    5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. <br>
    6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. <br>
    7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? <br>
    8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. <br>
    9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; <br>
    10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. <br>
    11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. <br>
    12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee. <br>
    13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother&rsquo;s womb. <br>
    14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. <br>
    15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. <br>
    16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. <br>
    17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! <br>
    18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. <br>
    19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. <br>
    20 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. <br>
    21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? <br>
    22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. <br>
    23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: <br>
    24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>David's
  Psalm reveals how very personal his relationship with God is. David
  displays the intense interest God has in every aspect of the lives of
  his people. And when did God begin to display this interest in David's
  life? There's the answer in verse 13, "For thou hast possessed my
  reins: thou hast covered me <b>in my mother&#8217;s womb.</b>" Let's face it, <b>David was certain that his life began in his mother's womb.<br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>Notice four attributes of God listed here by David:<br>
</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>God's omniscience (verses 1-6)</li>
  <li>God's omnipresence (verses 7-12)</li>
  <li>God's omnipotence as seen in the formation of man (verses 13-18)</li>
  <li>God's holiness, which destroys evil men and searches the Believer&#8217;s heart (verses 19-24)</li>
  </ul>

	<p>I find verses 21-22 particularly interesting here: &quot;Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?  I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.&quot; Ouch! That's not very politically correct in today's Christian circles. The Hebrew word there for &quot;perfect&quot; means &quot;complete/thorough.&quot; Hey! I don't make the news, I just report it. And...that's what David himself wrote in this Psalm with regard to his attitude toward those who have set themselves against God.<br>
      </p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Deliver me from my enemies (Psalm 143)<br>
	</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">A Psalm of David. <br>
	      1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. <br>
	      2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. <br>
	      3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. <br>
	      4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. <br>
	      5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. <br>
	      6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. <br>
	      7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. <br>
	      8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee. <br>
	      9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. <br>
	      10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness. <br>
	      11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name&rsquo;s sake: for thy righteousness&rsquo; sake bring my soul out of trouble. <br>
	      12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant. </font></p>

<p>David
  was waxing very poetic when he wrote this one. This is an acrostic
  Psalm like Psalm 119 (but much shorter). Each verse begins with the
  next letter of the Hebrew alphabet. There is one deviation from this
  acrostic style - no "nun," the equivalent to our letter "n." Without
  Hebrew manuscript evidence to do so, the NIV and the New Living
  Translation add a verse for this letter of the Hebrew alphabet and
  append the verse to the end of verse 13. Their reasoning for doing so apparently lies in its entry into the Greek Septuagint and a recent discovery of its presence in one of the documents discovered among the Dead Sea scrolls. Of the commonly used
  translations today, no other Bible translation with which I am familiar
  makes any attempt to enter it into the text with such weak textual evidence. This Psalm is all about praising
  God.</p>
