	<p>We
	  don't know who wrote this Psalm, but it seems to be the same author who
	  wrote this and Psalm 112. It opens and closes with a call to praise
	  God. Verse 5 says, "...he will ever be mindful of his covenant." He
	  says again in verse 9, "He sent redemption unto his people: he hath
	  commanded his covenant for ever:" It's not clear to which covenant he
	  refers, but it is likely the covenant God made with Abraham that is in
	  view here (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Abrahamic_Covenant.html" title="Abrahamic Covenant" target="_blank">see Abrahamic Covenant</a>). One thing is for certain; <b>the Psalmist knows the value of a covenant with God.<br>
      </b></p>
	<p>Except for the introduction, "Praise ye the LORD," this is an
acrostic Psalm. Each verse has two or three phrases - each beginning
with the next successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. This was an
oft-used poetic writing style in Hebrew.<b><br>

    </blockquote>
		<p>Probably
		  written by the same author as Psalm 111, here's a comparison
		  between the righteous and the wicked. It's also written in an acrostic poetry style (see notes on Psalm 111, above). We see in verse 1 the primary
		  characteristic of the righteous, "Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the
		  man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his
		  commandments." In the last verse (10) we see the consequence of the
		  wicked, "The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
		  his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish."</p>
	<p>In making his appeal about being generous in giving of one's resources, Paul quotes most of verse 9 in <a href="9-18.html#Key" title="II Corinthians 9 Summary" target="_blank">II Corinthians 9:9 (see notes)</a>, &quot;As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.&quot;</p>

</b></font> We are told that Psalms 113-118 were sung before and after
the passover feast each year - 113 and 114 before the meal and the
remaining four afterward. <a href="5-25.html#Supper" title="Mark 14 Summary" target="_blank">Mark 14:26 (see notes)</a> says, "And when they had sung an
hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives." This hymn that Jesus and
his disciples sang just prior to his crucifixion was likely taken from
Psalms 113-118. <strong>The identity of the author of these six Psalms is not
known.</strong><br>
</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Praise ye the LORD. (Psalm 113)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. <br>
    2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. <br>
    3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD&rsquo;S name is to be praised. <br>
    4 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. <br>
    5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, <br>
    6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! <br>
    7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; <br>
    8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. <br>
  9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Author
  unknown - this Psalm begins with, "Praise ye the LORD." It ends with
  the same phrase. All the verses in between demonstrate to us why the
  righteous should do so. </p>

</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; <br>
    2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. <br>
    3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. <br>
    4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. <br>
    5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? <br>
    6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs? <br>
    7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; <br>
    8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This
  Psalm isn't long, but it reminds the readers of God's manifestation to
  Israel in their deliverance from Egyptian captivity - the miraculous
  crossings of the Red Sea and Jordan, along with water from the rock. We
  aren't given the identity of the author for this Psalm. </p>

    2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? <br>
    3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. <br>
    4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men&rsquo;s hands. <br>
    5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: <br>
    6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: <br>
    7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. <br>
    8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. <br>
    9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. <br>

    11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. <br>
    12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. <br>
    13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. <br>
    14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children. <br>
    15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth. <br>
    16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD&rsquo;S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. <br>

<p>Our
  God is in Heaven. When the heathen question his presence, this unknown
  Psalmist simply points to the ridiculous notion that their lifeless
  idols have any god value whatsoever; they are powerless. </p>

<p>The author here is unknown. He points out that the
  relationship we have with God is our greatest asset. Look at the way he
  starts this Psalm, "I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and
  my supplications." It's a father-child relationship where God is intent
  on meeting our needs. Notice the confidence of the Psalmist in his
  eternal destiny with the Lord in verse 15, "Precious in the sight of
  the LORD is the death of his saints."</p>
<p>Incidentally, Paul quotes verse 10 in <a href="9-14.html#Instruments" title="II Corinthians 4 Summary" target="_blank">II Corinthians 4:13 (see notes)</a> to make the point that he is speaking by the same Spirit as this Psalmist.</p>

<p>Paul quotes verse 1 in <a title="Romans 15 Summary" href="8-25.html#Gentiles" target="_blank">Romans 15:11 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.&quot;  Note: Old Testament &quot;nations&quot; is synonymous with New Testament &quot;Gentiles.&quot; There he seeks to demonstrate this unknown Psalmists invitation for Gentiles to rejoice in the One True God. This Psalm is short, but the theme is long; God is eternal. Notice what he says about truth in verse 2, &quot;the truth of the LORD endureth for ever.&quot; Truth is a constant; it does not change. </p>

<p title="Acts 4 Summary">Although the author is unknown, here's
  a very quotable Psalm. Verse 8 says, "It is better to trust in the LORD
  than to put confidence in man." You gotta love that verse. This Psalm
  becomes very notable because of verse 22, "The stone which the builders
  refused is become the head stone of the corner." That's the verse Peter
  quoted in <a href="7-8.html#Sanhedrin" target="_blank">Acts 4:11 (see notes</a><a title="Acts 4 Summary" href="7-8.html#Justice" target="_blank">Isaiah 28:16 (see notes)</a>,
  "Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
  foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure
  foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste." Jesus is the
  cornerstone who was rejected. This verse is also used by Jesus himself
  in a parable to the Jewish leaders regarding his imminent crucifixion
  in <a title="Matthew 21:42/Mark 12:10/Luke 20:17 Summary" href="11-25.html#Who" target="_blank">I Peter 2:6 (see notes)</a>. </p>
<p>Jesus also quotes verse 26 in <a href="5-13.html#Woe" title="Matthew 23 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 23:39 (see notes)</a>. In that passage, Jesus proclaims with that quote that the Messianic requirement will be fulfilled after his resurrection.</p>
