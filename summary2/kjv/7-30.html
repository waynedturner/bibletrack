	<p><b><font size="4">Without a particular theme, I have noted some particularly meaningful and applicable proverbs from these three chapters.</font></b></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Who are you hangin' with? (Proverbs 13)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 A wise son heareth his father&rsquo;s instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke. <br>
	      2 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence. <br>
	      3 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. <br>
	      4 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. <br>
	      5 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame. <br>
	      6 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner. <br>
	      7 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches. <br>
	      8 The ransom of a man&rsquo;s life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke. <br>
	      9 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. <br>
	      10 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom. <br>
	      11 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase. <br>
	      12 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life. <br>
	      13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. <br>
	      14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. <br>
	      15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard. <br>
	      16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly. <br>
	      17 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health. <br>
	      18 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. <br>
	      19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil. <br>
	      20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. <br>
	      21 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed. <br>
	      22 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children&rsquo;s children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. <br>
	      23 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment. <br>
	      24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. <br>
	      25 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. <br>
  2 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. <br>
  3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. <br>
  4 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox. <br>
  5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies. <br>
  6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth. <br>
  7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge. <br>
  8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit. <br>
  9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour. <br>
  10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. <br>
  11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish. <br>
  12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. <br>
  13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness. <br>
  14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself. <br>
  15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going. <br>
  16 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident. <br>
  17 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. <br>
  18 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. <br>
  19 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. <br>
  20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends. <br>
  21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he. <br>
  22 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. <br>
  23 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury. <br>
  24 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly. <br>
  25 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies. <br>
  26 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. <br>
    27 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. <br>
    28 In the multitude of people is the king&rsquo;s honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. <br>
    29 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. <br>
    30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones. <br>
    31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor. <br>
    32 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death. <br>
    33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known. <br>
    34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people. <br>
  35 The king&rsquo;s favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Maybe laughter really is the best medicine. (Proverbs 15)</b></font><br>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger. <br>
  2 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness. <br>
  3 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. <br>
  4 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit. <br>
  5 A fool despiseth his father&rsquo;s instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent. <br>
  6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. <br>
  7 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so. <br>
  8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight. <br>
  9 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. <br>
  10 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die. <br>
  11 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men? <br>
  12 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise. <br>
  13 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. <br>
  14 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness. <br>
  15 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast. <br>
  16 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith. <br>
    17 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. <br>
    18 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife. <br>
    19 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain. <br>
    20 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother. <br>
    21 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly. <br>
    22 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established. <br>
    23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it! <br>
    24 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath. <br>
    25 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow. <br>
    26 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words. <br>
    27 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live. <br>
    28 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. <br>
    29 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous. <br>
    30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat. <br>
    31 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. <br>
    32 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding. <br>
  33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.</font></p>
