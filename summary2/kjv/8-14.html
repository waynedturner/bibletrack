    <p><font size="4"><b>Transcribed by Hezekiah's scholars<br>
				</b></font><b><font size="3">These three chapters are part of a group of five that started with </font></b><a title="Proverbs 25 Summary" href="9-24.html#Top" target="_blank">II Kings 18-20 and II Chronicles 29-32 (see notes)</a>. So, according to Proverbs 25:1, these proverbs in 25-29 were, indeed, written by Solomon, but not collected into book form until done so by Hezekiah's authority over 300 years later. Here, Solomon talks about reputation, integrity, wisdom and the fool.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Some practical living tips from Solomon (Proverbs 27)<br>
			</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. <br>
	      2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. <br>
	      3 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool&rsquo;s wrath is heavier than them both. <br>
	      4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy? <br>
	      5 Open rebuke is better than secret love. <br>
	      6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. <br>
	      7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. <br>
	      8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place. <br>
	      9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man&rsquo;s friend by hearty counsel. <br>
	      10 Thine own friend, and thy father&rsquo;s friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother&rsquo;s house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. <br>
	      11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. <br>
	      12 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished. <br>
	      13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. <br>
	      14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. <br>
	      15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. <br>
	      16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself. <br>
	      17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. <br>
	      18 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured. <br>
	      19 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. <br>
	      20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. <br>
	      21 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise. <br>
	      22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him. <br>
	      23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds. <br>
	      24 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation? <br>
	      25 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. <br>
	      26 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field. <br>
	      27 And thou shalt have goats&rsquo; milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens. </font></p>

<p><a name="Wisdom"></a><font size="4"><b>Assorted wisdom (Proverbs 28)<br>
			</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. <br>
    2 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged. <br>
    3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. <br>
    4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. <br>
    5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things. <br>
    6 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. <br>
    7 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father. <br>
    8 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. <br>
    9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. <br>
    10 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession. <br>
    11 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. <br>
    12 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. <br>
    13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. <br>
    14 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. <br>
    15 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people. <br>
    16 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. <br>
    17 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him. <br>
    18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. <br>
    19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. <br>
    20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. <br>
    21 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress. <br>
    22 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. <br>
    23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue. <br>
    24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer. <br>
    25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat. <br>
    26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. <br>
    27 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. <br>
    28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. <br>
    2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. <br>
    3 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance. <br>
    4 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. <br>
    5 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. <br>
    6 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. <br>
    7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it. <br>
    8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath. <br>
    9 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest. <br>
    10 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. <br>
    11 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards. <br>
    12 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked. <br>
    13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes. <br>
    14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. <br>
    15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame. <br>
    16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. <br>
    17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. <br>
    18 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. <br>
    19 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer. <br>
    20 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him. <br>
    21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length. <br>
    22 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. <br>
    23 A man&rsquo;s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. <br>
    24 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not. <br>
    25 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. <br>
    26 Many seek the ruler&rsquo;s favour; but every man&rsquo;s judgment cometh from the LORD. <br>
    27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked. </font></p>
