      28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead. <br>
      29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: <br>
      30 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger. <br>

      32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. <br>

	<p>There still hasn't been a Godly king in Israel (Hint: and there won't
	  be). Jeroboam's son, Nadab, becomes King of Israel (yeah, he's bad
	  too). Then <b>Baasha kills Nadab</b> and subsequently turns loose on all of Jeroboam's descendants and kills them also - guess no more kings from Jeroboam, just as the prophet Ahijah had said (<a title="I Kings 14 Summary" href="8-20.html#Hard" target="_blank">I Kings 14:1-20 (see notes)</a>; <b>Jeroboam was evil in the sight of God - stated again here in I Kings 15:30.</b> Now it's King Baasha...and, of course, he's bad too - just couldn't bring himself to serve God. <b>It just never became a

	      2 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; <br>

	    </blockquote>
		<p>Could the prophet, Jehu, have given a more negative prophecy concerning King Baasha of Israel? He declares that his lineage won't continue as kings over Israel. (Is it any wonder that the Israeli kings hated God's prophets?) His condemnation by the word of the prophet was because of Baasha's treachery and general state of evilness. He's followed by his son, Elah. We're now into the second dynasty of the newly-formed Northern Kingdom of Israel, and this dynasty will soon close out with the death of Baasha's son, Elah.</p>
		<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Elah"></a>A short reign for Elah (I Kings 16:8-14)</b></font> </p>
<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">8 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. <br>
	      9 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah. <br>
	      10 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. <br>
	      11 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends. <br>
	      12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, <br>
	      13 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. <br>
	      14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </font></p>
    </blockquote>
		<p>So, <b>Baasha dies, and Elah, his boy, becomes King of Israel - but only for two years.</b> <b>Zimri, one of the Israeli army commanders, kills him and takes over as King of Israel.</b>
		  He also wipes out the entirety of Baasha/Elah's male descendants to put
		  to rest once and for all the prophecy of Jehu against Baasha. <b>This
		    slaying of Baasha's male descendants is expressed in a very interesting
		    way in the Hebrew text. Of modern translations, only the King James Version keeps the Hebrew
		    phrase intact in I Kings 16:11;</b> that's exactly how the Hebrew phrase identifies these male heirs. We are told in verse 12 that this treachery was in accordance with Jehu's prophecy declaring the end of Baasha's dynasty. In addition, we see that Zimri not only slays the male heirs, but also Elah's other male relatives and even his male friends.</p>

		  the whole 7 days. <b>Whoa! Israel's Northern Kingdom is a tough place to serve as king;</b> it seems the moment you get the crown, someone is after your head. </p>
	<p>The dynasty math gets a little fuzzy here. Zimri was king (sorta) for only seven days after he killed Elah. Omri, who became the next king was not related to Zimri. Would you call Zimri's seven-day reign a dynasty? Since the definition of a dynasty is &quot;the succession of rulers from the same family,&quot; I guess Zimri by himself, does not constitute a dynasty. <strong>For seven days we're between dynasties two and three.</strong></p>

King Omri buys land and builds his new capital city, Samaria, named after the guy (Shemer) from whom he bought it. He reigns in Israel for 12 1/2 years.

    </blockquote>
		<p><b>Omri's boy, Ahab, becomes King of Israel;</b>
		  his wife, Jezebel, helps make his reign a notable one. Jezebel's father
		  was Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians. Sidon (home of the Zidonians) was a
		  Philistine city north of Israel on the coast. <b>Why don't parents name their daughters &quot;Jezebel?&quot;</b> As we read, it may become apparent. He and Jezebel were way into Baal worship - built a worship center to Baal in Samaria. He also set up &quot;a grove&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;asherah&quot;), which was actually a wooden image, or a pillar representing Ashtoreth, a sensual Canaanitish goddess. In pagan societies, she often served as the female complement to Baal. In gleaning from the usage in the Old Testament, it is commonly believed that &quot;Ashtoreth&quot; was the proper name of the goddess, while &quot;Asherah&quot; was the name of her image or symbol, which was constructed of wood.</p>
		<p><b>Ahab and Jezebel had no use for God or the things of God. </b>Ahab commissions the rebuilding of Jericho despite the prophecy of Joshua against doing so in <a title="Joshua 6 Summary" href="4-21.html#Jericho" target="_blank">Joshua 6:26 (see notes)</a> &quot;And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.&quot; And...just as the prophecy had stated, Hiel, the man commissioned to the rebuilding project, loses his eldest and youngest sons, just as Joshua had said (verse 34).</p>
	<p>Ahab and Jezebel are two very colorful and evil figures in Israel's history. <b>Ahab is credited with a unique distinction in verse 33</b>, "Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him." <b>How's that for the record books!</b></p>

	      8 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests. <br>
	      9 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people. <br>
	      10 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat. <br>
	      11 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats. <br>
	      12 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store. <br>
	      13 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem. <br>
	      14 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand. <br>
	      15 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand. <br>
	      16 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour. <br>
	      17 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand. <br>
	      18 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war. <br>
	      19 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah. </font></p>

		<p>While the Northern Kingdom was screaming through a line of kings, the Southern Kingdom gets <b>Jehoshaphat</b> as their king, mentioned first in <a title="I Kings 15 Summary" href="8-30.html#Aftermath" target="_blank">II Chronicles 20:33 (see notes)</a> that they later reappeared, and he let it go. <b>Fighting idol worship was a constant uphill battle among the Jews. </b>But look at Jehoshaphat's army. I count it to be altogether well over 1 million strong! No wonder all the kings around him were sending gifts. He was zealous in the ways of the Lord - even sending priests and teachers out to the people of Israel to teach them the ways of the One True God. Jehoshaphat stays around through chapter 20. And he gets a lot of coverage in I and II Kings as well, from I Kings 15 all the way to II Kings 8 when his son, Jehoram, begins to reign.</p>
