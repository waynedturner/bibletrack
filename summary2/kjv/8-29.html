<p><font size="4"><b>These Corinthians had some problems - big problems</b></font><br>
    Paul deals with some Christian-living issues in his writings to the Corinthians that he doesn't address to any of
    the other churches to whom he wrote. <b>These people, made up predominantly of Gentiles, brought a lot of pagan
        culture into the church.</b> After all, the city of Corinth where they lived was the home of the <b>Temple of
        Aphrodite.</b> In Greek mythology, Aphrodite is the goddess of love, beauty and sexual rapture. Our English word
    Aphrodisiac comes from this mythological character. Because Corinth was home of two separate converging shipping
    ports, a lot of commerce passed through the city. Thus, it was always full of sailors looking for a &quot;good time.&quot;
    And the temple did not disappoint them.<b> Temple-sponsored prostitution was provided for all the visitors and
        residents alike.</b> It was commonplace there - so much so, that in the minds of the residents, <b>abuse of
        alcohol, sexual promiscuity and brawling represented normal conduct.</b> In I Corinthians, Paul deals with
    issues of sinful practice within the church itself that go way beyond what Christians today can even imagine. It's a
    gross understatement to simply make the observation that this was a very spiritually-troubled church.</p>
<p><b>It is generally believed that I Corinthians was written by Paul while on his third missionary journey from Ephesus
    in 55/56 A.D.</b></p>

        with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: <br>
        3 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. <br>
        4 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; <br>
        5 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; <br>

        7 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: <br>

<p>We find Paul's greeting to the church in verses 1-3. You will notice that Paul is careful to note his calling as an
    Apostle. We'll see him defend that calling in <a title="I Corinthians 9 Summary" href="7-28.html#Corinth"

    Corinth. It would appear that Sosthenes received Christ and became a disciple.</p>

                    is &quot;hagios&quot; - the result of having been sanctified. Therefore, Believers are those who
                    have been dedicated to God, and thus are called &quot;saints.&quot; Referring to a Believer as a
                    &quot;saint&quot; only speaks to the salvation covenant established between God and that Believer, a

<p><b>Paul establishes some basic principles regarding salvation in verse 2. You will note that the church (Greek:
    ekklesia - called out assembly) at Corinth is made up of people who:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>are &quot;sanctified in Christ Jesus&quot;

    <li>are &quot;called to be saints&quot;
    <li>&quot;call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord&quot;
</ul>
<p>Believers are those who have been &quot;sanctified in Christ Jesus&quot; at the time of their salvation experience
    and thus are &quot;called to be saints&quot; because they &quot;call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;
    The local assembly is to be comprised of those who have established themselves as &quot;saints&quot; through
    trusting Jesus Christ as their savior. <a title="Salvation words"
                                              href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Salvation_words.html"

<p>In verse 3, Paul extends his standard greeting expressing his desire that they experience grace and peace from God in
    their walk as Believers. Then he gets right down to business with comments packed full of meaning - perhaps even
    double meanings. In verse 4 he commends them for the grace of God, but he's obviously talking about more than just
    saving grace here as is evidenced in verse 5 which starts with a Greek conjunction (&quot;hoti&quot;) indicating
    that <b>his comments through verse 7 are offshoots of the &quot;grace&quot; in verse 4.</b> As a result, these
    Corinthians &quot;come behind in no gift&quot; (verse 7), which becomes part of the problem he deals with in <a
            title="I Corinthians 12-13 Summary" href="9-10.html#Superiority" target="_blank">14 (see notes)</a>, the
    excessive practices (with spiritual gifts) observed in their corporate worship services. In verses 8-9, Paul
    prepares them for the comments of rebuke that will follow, assuring them that he is not questioning the authenticity
    of their salvation experience and is emphasizing God's ability to preserve them in Jesus Christ. With that said, now
    it's time to begin addressing the problems within the church.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Paul gets right to one of the big problems in the church there, contention. Being a much-desired travel spot, the
    Corinthian Christians had been exposed to several teachers presenting Christ. <b>They had developed little pockets
        of loyalties to people</b> like Cephas (Peter), Paul and Apollos. Add that to their list of contentious
    issues...sort of like sports fans today argue over who's the best among their favorite players. <b>Paul here is not
        discouraging baptism;</b> he's just thankful that he, personally, did not add to this division by baptizing
    people in this church himself. I'm confident he left that to the local pastor instead. Paul served in the capacity
    of an apostle, not as the pastor of the churches he visited. </p>
<p>Incidentally, Crispus was likely the head of the Corinthian synagogue (<a title="Acts 18 Summary"
                                                                             href="7-24.html#Jailer" target="_blank">Acts
    16:25-40 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p>Some have used these comments by Paul to formulate an opinion that water baptism is not that significant for a
    Believer. That's simply not so. While water baptism does not make a person more saved, Paul treats it with great
    significance for the new Christian in <a href="8-17.html#Baptism" title="Romans 6 Summary" target="_blank">Romans
        6:1-14 (see notes)</a>.</p>

        prudent. <br>
        20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the

</blockquote>
<p>The discussion for the balance of this chapter is framed by verse 18, &quot;For <b>the preaching of the cross is to
    them that perish foolishness</b>; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.&quot; The &quot;preaching of
    the cross&quot; is a term Paul used to describe the message of the Gospel - the saving power of the death, burial
    and resurrection of Jesus Christ (as defined in <a href="9-10.html#Gospel" title="I Corinthians 15 Summary"
                                                       target="_blank">I Corinthians 15:1-4, see notes)</a>. Corinth was
    a big Greek city. Greeks considered themselves very sophisticated...and smart. Greek culture was considered by them
    to be a cut above the culture of other societies. That being the case, their intellectual heroes were Greeks, and
    they had a tendency to count inferior anything not Greek with regard to religion (well, anything actually). That's
    why Paul deals extensively with this issue in these verses. </p>
<p>In verse 19, while describing those who hold a disdain for the Gospel message, Paul quotes <a
        title="Isaiah 29 Summary" href="12-31.html#White" title="Revelation 20 Summary" target="_blank">see notes on
    Revelation 20:11-15</a>).</p>
<p>Paul explains in these verses that secular wisdom is at odds with God's wisdom - so much so, that our so-called
    intellectuals of today still mock the things of God. But where does real wisdom come from? Verse 30 says, &quot;But
    of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God <b>is made unto us wisdom,</b> and righteousness, and sanctification, and
    redemption:&quot; In other words, as Believers, we are &quot;made&quot; wise and righteous in Christ. <b>Truth is
        truth, so just bring on the mockery; we can take it!</b></p>
<p><a name="Message"></a><font size="4"><b>A simple message: Christ crucified (I Corinthians 2:1-5)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring
        unto you the testimony of God. <br>
        2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. <br>
        3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. <br>
        4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man&rsquo;s wisdom, but in demonstration of the
        Spirit and of power: <br>
        5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Verses 1-5 may not seem particularly significant to the casual reader, but I have adopted them as the definitive way
    in which I conduct my preaching ministry. In essence, here is what Paul is saying: &quot;The power of God is in the
    Word of God.&quot; For the first several years of my preaching ministry I ignored the admonition of my Homiletics
    professor, Dr. Steve Euler, who encouraged us to stick to expository preaching. When I finally came around to
    capturing the essence of what Paul is declaring in these five verses, <b>I realized that Paul is saying: Skip the
        fancy oratory; just tell them what God has said in HIS WORD!</b> Since coming to that realization, I have
    adopted a practice of ceasing from my efforts to prepare a fancy oratory (which I wasn't very good at anyway), and I
    just try to stick to telling the congregation the truths I have discovered in the passage I've been studying the
    preceding week - expository preaching. If you've heard me preach, you know that I quote I Corinthians 2:4-5 at the
    beginning of each message.<b> I want to remind myself and the congregation that the power of God is in the Word of
        God; it's not to be found in fancy or stirring oratory.</b> Fancy, dynamic oratory may stir the emotions, but
    it's the substance of the message that will strengthen Believers for the long haul.</p>
<p>You will notice that Paul focuses on what he knew - the clear message of life in Christ. He made no attempt to
    compete in knowledge or wisdom on other fronts - just the preaching of Christ. It is worth taking note once again
    the value of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Had Jesus died a natural death, he would have had no power to save
    anyone. Paul's clear presentation of that fact is seen in his formal definition of the Gospel to be found in <a
            href="9-10.html#Gospel" title="I Corinthians 15 Summary" target="_blank">I Corinthians 15:1-4, see
        notes)</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Wisdom"></a><font size="4"><b>How does one get spiritual wisdom? (I Corinthians 2:6-16)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of
        the princes of this world, that come to nought: <br>
        7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto
        our glory: <br>
        8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of
        glory. <br>
        9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things
        which God hath prepared for them that love him. <br>
        10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things
        of God. <br>
        11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God
        knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. <br>
        12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the
        things that are freely given to us of God. <br>
        13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man&rsquo;s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost
        teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. <br>
        14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither
        can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. <br>
        15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. <br>
        16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. </font>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wisdom of the world is contrary to God's wisdom, a point that Paul began dealing with all the way back in 1:18
    (<a href="#Greeks">see above</a>). <b>The world has always been bent on disproving and discounting God.</b> Just
    look back at Noah's era and later the tower of Babel - no use for God. Why is that? <b>Rebels don't like
        boundaries.</b> They eliminate (at least in their minds) the boundaries by explaining away He who makes the
    boundaries. In verse 6 Paul identifies the group who will understand his message - the &quot;perfect&quot; (Greek:
    &quot;teleios&quot; means &quot;mature&quot; or &quot;complete&quot;). The Greek word for &quot;mystery&quot; in
    verse 7 is &quot;musterion.&quot; As you can see, &quot;mystery&quot; is a near transliteration of the Greek word
    which literally means, &quot;that which cannot be known by the natural mind.&quot; In other words, these spiritual
    concepts can only be digested by a spiritually mature mind.</p>
<p>So, don't ever hold out hope that the secular mind will ever draw the conclusion in his style of wisdom that God is
    the center of the universe; it just won't happen. In verse 9, Paul quotes from <a title="Isaiah 64 Summary"
                                                                                      href="10-11.html#Continuation"
                                                                                      target="_blank">Isaiah 64:4 (see
        notes)</a>, &quot;For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither
    hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.&quot; That verse draws
    attention to the totally unexpected grace God bestows on those who love him.</p>
<p>&quot;Wisdom&quot; is translated from the Greek word &quot;sophia.&quot; We get our word &quot;sophomore&quot; from
    this Greek word, defined by the The American Heritage Dictionary, &quot;...probably influenced by Greek sophos,
    wise, and moros, stupid.&quot; Therefore a sophomore is a wise stupid person. Yeah...I believe that just about
    describes it. <b>The world has devised its own system of wise thinking, but our wisdom comes from the indwelling of
        the Holy Spirit.</b> When we are filled, and thus controlled by the Holy Spirit, we have the mind of God when it
    comes to...well...everything. It's a great mind to have! The world doesn't get it according to verse 14, &quot;But
    the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he
    know them, because they are spiritually discerned.&quot; <b>Lost people </b>(those with a &quot;natural&quot;
    mind)<b> don't like our thinking processes...and don't want to. </b>We see the world through spiritual eyes given to
    us by the Holy Spirit, and they see the world from the perspective of the established world order. That's what verse
    13 means when it indicates that the indwelling of the Holy Spirit helps us in our thinking process by &quot;comparing
    spiritual things with spiritual.&quot; Our wisdom arises from the &quot;spiritual&quot; precepts found in God's
    Word. Where did their world order come from? <a title="II Corinthians 4 Summary" href="9-14.html#Word"
                                                    target="_blank">II Corinthians 4:3-4 (see notes)</a> says, &quot;But
    if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom<b> the god of this world hath blinded the minds of
        them which believe not,</b> lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should
    shine unto them.&quot; The &quot;god of this world&quot; in that passage is Satan himself.&quot; Quite on the
    contrary, however, <b>Paul frames the contrast when he says of Believers in verse 16, &quot;But we have the mind of

        able. <br>
        3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal,

</blockquote>
<p>This church at Corinth was a bickering church. They struggled about everything. As we saw in chapter 1, they even
    divided over who they followed with regard to spiritual leaders, again mentioned here in verse 4 regarding Apollos (<a
            href="#What">see above</a>). <b>Paul calls these Corinthians &quot;carnal&quot; rather than &quot;spiritual&quot;
        in verse 1.</b> Now here's a very important concept of scripture: <b>Spirit-led Believers do not bicker; they
        are always unified.</b> It is impossible that the Holy Spirit indwelling me will ever cause me to struggle with
    another Believer who is also led by the Holy Spirit. <b>So, why do Christians (like those in Corinth) struggle with
        each other? It is ALWAYS because one or more are not being led by the Holy Spirit.</b></p>
<p>It only takes one to cause division...and his spiritual classification in that state is that of a &quot;carnal&quot;
    Believer. Now, let's not go overboard here. We're talking contentious behavior in this discussion. I do have
    opinions about things. My favorite colors are blue and red (I'm a Crayola 8 kind of guy); the one who picked out the
    color scheme for our church had a strong partiality for green. Do people in churches actually divide and contend
    over color schemes used as they decorate their churches? Yup...every day! How can something that trivial cause
    friction and division in a church? Answer: no leadership of the Holy Spirit. <b>The Holy Spirit gives each Believer
        perspective; it keeps the main thing the main thing in our lives.</b> The Holy Spirit helps us identify the real
    enemy - Satan! The Holy Spirit inside helps us defer to others on our trivial preferences. Paul said in <a
            title="Philippians 2 Summary" href="10-12.html#Emulate" target="_blank">Philippians 2:3-4 (see notes)</a>,
    &quot;Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than
    themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.&quot; This is
    fulfilled naturally in Spirit-led Believers. <b>We may have preferences different from other Believers, but we never
        allow them to become points of contention. </b>By the way, the Holy Spirit will always lead us to contend with
    Satan. When Satan attacks, we're there!</p>
<p>These contentious Believers are spiritually immature - thus the reference to &quot;milk&quot; nourishment in verse 2.
    The analogy is clear. Kids don't understand the big picture and therefore make immature decisions that may result in
    harm...because they lack wisdom. Likewise, immature Believers who assert themselves on spiritual issues will many
    times come to the incorrect judgment on issues. Why? It's because of their frame of reference - their paradigm, just
    as those Paul refers to in chapter 2 who have the &quot;wisdom of the world,&quot; but not the wisdom of God. When
    others, who weigh situations based upon spiritual principles (I Corinthians 2:13, <a href="#Wisdom">see above</a>),
    disagree with them, they become contentious. Spiritual decision making does not make sense to a carnal Believer.</p>
<p>There's another point worth mentioning in this passage of scripture. <b>Many Christians today tend to think that a
    so-called Believer who displays carnal-looking actions in his/her life is doing so because of not being truly
    saved.</b> Many have incorrectly concluded that all saved people look and act like saved people all the time. <b>Verse
    1 is clear: these people (those in the Corinthian church) are regarded by Paul to be Christians</b> (he calls them
    &quot;brethren&quot;)<b>, and yet they are carnal.</b> You must understand, life is tough for a carnal Christian.
    I've always considered this carnal state in one's Christian life to be transitional - not permanent. <b>Carnal
        living for the Believer is hampered by such passages as <a title="Hebrews 12 Summary"
                                                                   href="11-17.html#Chastisement" target="_blank">
            Hebrews 12, (see notes)</a></b>. Here's the deal: <b>God does not overlook rebellion in the Believer.</b>
</p>
<p>As Paul discusses the various aspects of ministering - Paul having planted and Apollos (<a href="#What">see &quot;Apollos&quot;
    notes above</a>) having watered at Corinth, he transitions into the importance of each role by linking it to rewards
    for each; he illustrates his point with the construction of a building in verse 9 and fully develops his analogy in
    verses 10-15.</p>
<p><a name="Rewards"></a><font size="4"><b>How about those rewards? (I Corinthians 3:10-15)</b></font><br>
    <em><strong>The Judgment Seat of Christ</strong></em></p>

        foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. <br>
        11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. <br>
        12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; <br>
        13 Every man&rsquo;s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by
        fire; and the fire shall try every man&rsquo;s work of what sort it is. <br>
        14 If any man&rsquo;s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. <br>
        15 If any man&rsquo;s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by
        fire. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though speaking specifically about the various aspects of labor shared by Apollos and himself, Paul compares the
    Christian life to a building - a building metaphor. <b>Christ is the foundation, and we build upon that foundation
        with our life-long actions - just as he and Apollos had done.</b> Spiritually-based actions add to the
    foundation gold, silver and precious stone; carnally-based actions...wood, hay and stubble. After the rapture (<a
            title="I Thessalonians 4 Summary" href="11-17.html#Chastisement" target="_blank">Hebrews 12:3-17 (see
        notes)</a> again.</p>
<p><b>Lesson: the spirit-led life is productive; the carnal nature of man, when allowed to manifest itself, is divisive
    and non productive.</b></p>
<p>In fact, there are six separate judgments of mankind seen in scripture. <strong>The judgment seat of Christ</strong>
    seen here is just one of the six. <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Judgments.html"

<p>Verse 16 says we are the housing for the Holy Spirit. This concept contrasts with that of the Old Testament where
    God's dwelling place was inside the Tabernacle and later Solomon's Temple <a
            href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Shekinah_glory.html" title="The Shekinah Glory"
            target="_blank">(see article entitled &quot;The Shekinah Glory&quot;)</a>.Yes, today God no longer inhabits
    a man-made structure, but rather is inside every Believer.<b> Think about it - you're like a mobile sanctuary
        walking around with God inside.</b> Paul intentionally emphasizes the importance in these verses of displaying
    ourselves as houses of God...with all the appropriate attention to godliness in our actions. And finally...when you
    bicker with another mobile house of God, you're just manifesting that you're not allowing God to control your mobile
    sanctuary. CAN'T WE JUST ALL GET ALONG? Yes! We can...when we are all led by God's Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 17 is quite sobering, &quot;If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God
    is holy, which temple ye are.&quot; We're once again back to the discussion of chastisement for disobedient
    Believers according to the guidelines of <a title="I Corinthians 11 Summary" href="11-17.html#Chastisement"
                                                target="_blank">Hebrews 12:3-17 (see notes)</a>. Paul wants to make
    certain that those who fit the description of &quot;carnal&quot; (verse 1, <a href="#Division">see above</a>)
    understand that there is a price to pay - a physical destruction. Look at context here: If the &quot;body&quot; is
    physical in verse 16 (and it is), then verse 17 references physical destruction for disobedient Believers (those who
    defile their visible testimony). For those who spend their time worrying that disobedient professing Christians are
    getting away with something, worry no more; they aren't. God knows who they are and has it all under control.</p>
<p>Let's tie this discussion up now. What about these &quot;carnal&quot; but &quot;wise in this world&quot; Believers of
    verse 18. They have no edge with God; their worldly wisdom is futile. Paul then takes us back to the issue that
    began this discussion by referring to the issue of divisions regarding mentors in verses 22-23. <b>It doesn't matter
        who your spiritual mentor was, we are to be unified in Jesus Christ through the indwelling leadership of the
        Holy Spirit - no room for carnality or worldly wisdom.</b></p>
<p>Incidentally, Paul quotes <a title="Job 5 Summary" href="1-6.html#Eliphaz" target="_blank">Job 5:13 (see notes)</a>
    in verse 19, &quot;He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.&quot; That's a true statement by Eliphaz in his
    speech to Job; his speech was otherwise riddled with misunderstandings about God's dealings with man, but that
    statement is, nonetheless, true.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Paul adds to the discussion of mentors (I Corinthians 4)</b></font><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
        <br>
        2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. <br>
        3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man&rsquo;s judgment: yea, I judge
        not mine own self. <br>
        4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. <br>
        5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things
        of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
        <br>
        6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye
        might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one
        against another. <br>
        7 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst
        receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? <br>
        8 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that
        we also might reign with you. <br>
        9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a
        spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. <br>
        10 We are fools for Christ&rsquo;s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are
        honourable, but we are despised. <br>
        11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain
        dwellingplace; <br>
        12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: <br>
        13 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto
        this day. <br>
        14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you. <br>
        15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I
        have begotten you through the gospel. <br>
        16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. <br>
        17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall
        bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. <br>
        18 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. <br>
        19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up,
        but the power. <br>
        20 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. <br>
        21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness? </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Paul is still talking about his issue of division over spiritual mentors that he began in chapter 3 (<a
        href="#Division">see above</a>). From this chapter, it would appear that there were those in the church at
    Corinth who expressed a good bit of disdain for Paul...apparently in favor toward Apollos or Peter (Cephas). Paul
    says in verse 3 that their negative appraisal of him is no big deal (&quot;a very small thing&quot;); he acquires
    his worth from God (verse 4). He goes on to tell them that they would be better served to let God do the evaluation
    of worth. So...by what authority does Paul correct these Corinthians? He deals with that in this chapter. </p>
<p><b>Note the references to his own ministry among the Corinthians that Paul emphasizes:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>a minister of Christ (verse 1)
    <li>a steward of the mysteries of God (verse 2)
    <li>an apostle (verse 9)
    <li>their spiritual father (verse 15)
</ul>
<p>Effective ministry is everything to Paul's motivation as an Apostle of Christ. Why should they &quot;defame&quot;
    (verse 13) Paul? He is the spiritual father (verse 15) of many of them. In other words, <b>he led them to Christ
        through the Gospel.</b> Also, he has considered his life worthless except to preach the Gospel; he has
    sacrificed everything for this mission. One more thing: Through extreme hardship, <b>Paul lives his life in such a
        way that he serves as an example to be followed with respect to living the Christian life.</b></p>
<p>Many preachers/teachers have used verse 2 as a verse on giving money to the church. That's not really what it is.
    Verse 2 has nothing to do with money in its direct application.<b> The Greek word for &quot;stewards&quot;
        (oikonomos) here is literally a word that refers to someone who is in charge of the affairs of a household.</b>
    In those days, it was typically a slave entrusted with household affairs...and in charge of the other household
    slaves. He was responsible for everything that went right and everything that went wrong. <b>Paul describes himself
        as a steward of the Gospel. He must spread it and teach it properly; it's been entrusted to him just like the
        steward of a household.</b></p>
<p>What we are in Christ is received by grace - God's free gift to Believers. Paul points this out to the high-minded
    Corinthians in verses 7 and 8 by using some sarcastic irony. Some of these Corinthians apparently thought they were
    special in the church apart from the grace of Christ. So here's the lesson.<b> Everything you are spiritually that
        makes a difference is given to you by God; so stop bragging about it!</b> Paul continues with the irony in verse
    10 with the suggestions that these conceited Corinthians were the &quot;wise, strong and honorable&quot; ones
    instead of Paul himself.</p>
<p>Then Paul deals with the pride of the Corinthians. He notes that their pride exceeds that claimed by any of the
    Apostles of Christ. So what's up with that? Answer: The Corinthians had unmerited pride.</p>
<p><b>Paul calls upon them to become humble before God.</b> He invokes the fact in verses 15 and 16 that he is their
    spiritual father, and fathers serve as examples to their children. Here's a contradiction to the old unscriptural
    idiom, &quot;Don't do as I do; do as I say!&quot; Let's face it - <b>you and I both have a responsibility to live
        lives before God that are acceptable examples to others. Like it or not, you will be emulated by others.</b></p>
<p>Oh...one more thing. Apparently some had taken it as a personal insult that Paul had sent Timothy to them instead of
    coming himself (verses 17-18). Let's face it; some of the &quot;carnal&quot; Believers at Corinth were just stirring
    up trouble. Regarding his future visit to the Corinthians, his desire is to have these matters of contention
    straightened out before his arrival so that he can come &quot;in the spirit of meekness&quot; rather than to
    chastise them (verse 21). You gotta love verse 20, &quot;<font size="3">For the kingdom of God is not in word, but
        in power.</font>&quot; It's not what you say, but rather who's backing you up?</p>

<p>Here's the situation at the church there in Corinth. They had a man in their church who was having <b>sexual
    relations with his father's wife.</b> It does not say his mother, so we assume it must have been his step mother.
    Literally, the Greek phraseology reads, &quot;a certain woman [wife] of his father to have.&quot; Remember what I
    said in the introduction about the moral state of the city of Corinth; they were waaaaaay depraved! This depravity
    had affected the mindset of the people in the church there. <b>Paul even goes so far in verse 2 as to identify their
        motivation for taking no action when he says that they &quot;are puffed up&quot; (Greek: phusioo - conceited).
        In other words, there was no expression of sorrow on the part of the congregation that this was taking place
        within their local assembly because they were conceited (proud) of their openmindedness. </b>What's worse, even
    Gentiles had no tolerance for this kind of conduct according to verse 1. And as far as the Jewish Believers go, take
    note of <a title="Deuteronomy 22 Summary" href="4-13.html#Betrothal" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 22:30 (see
        notes)</a>, &quot;A man shall not take his father&#146;s wife, nor discover his father&#146;s skirt.&quot;</p>
<p>Now understand this from verses 3-4: Even though Paul is not at Corinth and probably does not understand the
    circumstances around the personalities involved, he still proclaims that the solution is plain. That's important
    inasmuch as there are those that would suggest in churches today that the context of the activity might yield a
    different opinion. NO! Sin is sin; all Paul needs to know about the circumstances are reported in verse 1. More
    investigation is not necessary to make a declarative judgment.</p>
<p>Paul's instructions to them can be found in verse 5, &quot;To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of
    the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.&quot; What does that mean?<b> It's clear what
        it means when we look at the explanation given in verse 9, &quot;I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company
        with fornicators.&quot;</b> Then we see from verse 13 exactly what is meant, <b>&quot;Therefore put away from
        among yourselves that wicked person.&quot;</b> It's clear: <b>Put him out of the church.</b> But wait! There's
    more! <b>Not only do they put him out of the church, but they agree not to have fellowship with him at all - even
        outside the church. </b>Look at verse 11, &quot;But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man
    that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an
    extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.&quot; </p>
<p>A distinction is made here in verses 9-10. <b>Paul says that you can't shun everyone involved in sin, but you must
    shun those calling themselves Believers who are involved in this kind of depraved conduct.</b> The reason? It's done
    so that they will be shamed for their abominable conduct. Paul explains in this chapter that we have no control over
    judging the lost, but <b>we must not tolerate open rebellion against God within our fellowship.</b> Paul's reference
    to leaven in verses 6-8 is a picture of sin (leaven equals sin here). On the eve of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
    anything that contained leaven was eliminated from the house of observant Jews. <b>Likewise, Paul compares the sin
        of this man to leaven.</b> If you don't get rid of leaven, it spreads. <b>Likewise, if you don't eliminate open
        rebellion against God from your fellowship, it spreads also.</b></p>
<p>Yup! Harsh words for a harsh situation. &quot;Where's the love!&quot; you might ask. <b>The love is shown by
    demonstrating to this person his need to repent of his actions and rejoin the fellowship of Believers pursuing
    victorious Christian living.</b> In light of this passage, can there really be any question about how to properly
    handle the issues of immorality prevalent in many of today's churches?</p>
<p>Now the question may arise concerning the scope of these verses. Verses 12-13 make it clear that the church at
    Corinth has no authority to judge them &quot;that are without&quot; i.e. those who are not part of the local
    assembly there. <strong>The responsibility of the church is to make certain such offenders are not counted as part
        of the local assembly.</strong> So, what about fellowship with such professing Christians who are not part of
    one's local assembly? The admonition of verse 11 had been previously communicated to the folks at Corinth when Paul
    speaks generally, &quot;<font size="3">But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is
        called a brother be a fornicator [Greek: pornos], or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an
        extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.&quot;</font> Hmmm...does that mandate only apply to those under
    formal church discipline? The wording of verse 11 indicates that it is a previously-stated general declaration that
    just happens to apply in this particular situation. </p>
<p>Paul makes a similar statement in <a href="10-8.html#Walk" title="Ephesians 5 Summary" target="_blank">Ephesians 5:11
    (see notes)</a> where he says, &quot;And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
    reprove them.&quot; The list of unacceptable conduct in that passage includes &quot;fornication&quot; (Greek:
    porneia - sexual misconduct), the same Greek root as &quot;pornos&quot; (fornicator) in I Corinthians 5:11. In the
    Ephesians 5 passage, there is no context of local church discipline. There it is a general statement that Believers
    are not to hang with those who practice this type of conduct; they should &quot;reprove&quot; (rebuke) them instead.
    <strong>In other words, I Corinthians 5:11 and Ephesians 5:11 stand on their own as appropriate to be applied to all
        of those who practice morally-disgusting conduct, but especially toward those who profess to be
        Christians.</strong> Finally, pay close attention to the motivation for shunning these sinning Believers - to
    shame them for their conduct for the purpose of causing them to want to restore fellowship with God and their fellow
    Believers.</p>
<p>To draw an example of this Biblical concept from the Old Testament, consider the ministry of Jeremiah. Because his
    fellow Jews in Jerusalem had rejected the counsel of God through his prophesying, God told Jeremiah to have no
    fellowship with these people because of their persistent wickedness. God even told Jeremiah not to attend their
    funerals in <a href="10-25.html#Drought" title="Jeremiah 14 Summary" target="_blank">Jeremiah 14, see notes</a>).
</p>
<p>In conclusion, Paul begins a rebuke of these Corinthians in verses 12-13 for having not been willing to &quot;judge&quot;
    this man within their own congregation. This discussion transitions into the issue of <a
            title="I Corinthians 6 Summary" href="9-2.html#Lawsuits" target="_blank">I Corinthians 6 (see notes)</a> -
    their apparent practice of taking one another to civil court rather than taking problems between Believers before a
    local church council.</p>
