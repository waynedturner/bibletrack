		<p>Of all the people among whom God could have chosen to dwell, we're it. Of all the places in which God could have had a temple built, this is it. Solomon blesses the people of Jerusalem this day. As he speaks to the people of Israel, he reviews the provisions of the Davidic Covenant proclaiming that Israel is the nation of God and that the throne of David shall endure forever (<a href="6-19.html#Temple" title="II Samuel 7 Summary" target="_blank">II Samuel 7:12-16, see notes</a>). In his presentation, he points out that God had authorized the building of this new temple by David's son, Solomon himself.</p>

      13 For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven, <br>
      14 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts: <br>
      15 Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day. <br>
      16 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me. <br>
      17 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David. <br>
      18 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built! <br>
      19 Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee: <br>
      20 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place. <br>
      21 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive. <br>
      22 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house; <br>
      23 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness. <br>
      24 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house; <br>
      25 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers. <br>
      26 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them; <br>
      27 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance. <br>
      28 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be: <br>
      29 Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house: <br>
      30 Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:) <br>
      31 That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. <br>
      32 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name&rsquo;s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house; <br>
      33 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name. <br>
      34 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name; <br>
      35 Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. <br>
      36 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near; <br>
      37 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly; <br>
      38 If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name: <br>
      39 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee. <br>
      40 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. <br>
      41 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness. <br>

      26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. <br>

      35 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: <br>
      36 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. <br>
      37 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; <br>
      38 What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: <br>

      40 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. <br>
      41 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name&rsquo;s sake; <br>
      42 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house; <br>

      48 And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: <br>
      49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause, <br>
      50 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them: <br>
      51 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: <br>
      52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee. <br>
      53 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD. <br>

<p>This is the same looooong prayer that we also see in <a title="I Kings 8 Summary" href="8-7.html#Dedication" target="_blank">I Kings 8:22-53 (see notes)</a>. <font color="#0000FF">That text is shown in blue above.</font> The people are listening in as Solomon kneels on a scaffold built there in the temple courtyard especially for this occasion. Solomon outlines the supernatural aspects of the new temple. Notice Solomon's acknowledgment of the fact that we are all sinners in verse 36. As a matter of fact, Solomon's prayer here is one that points out that man's solutions to his problems are to be found in prayer before God.</p>

      7 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat. <br>
      8 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt. <br>
      9 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. <br>
      10 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. <br>
    11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king&rsquo;s house: and all that came into Solomon&rsquo;s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected. </font></td>

<p>Remember the big pool for the priests to wash in before they sacrifice? Second question: Do you remember from <a title="I Chronicles 24 Summary" href="7-13.html#Shift" target="_blank">I Chronicles 24 (see notes)</a> the 24,000 Levites who were assigned to 24 shifts to work in the temple? Well, the really big pool gets a really big visitation this first week - we're getting ready to sacrifice 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep...and those who were priests must be ceremonially clean when they do it. Oh - and remember the really, really big altar (about 36.5 feet square) that was built for sacrificing animals? It's getting ready to get a steady workout for this dedication. So...imagine with me the dedication scene - let's guess 48 or so priests simultaneously sacrificing at this altar 48 or so animals at a time every 2 to 5 minutes - the sounds, the smell, the hustle - simply an amazing sight and sound. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure I would have had the stomach for priest work. After 7 days, the people went home - whew!</p>

<p>Solomon gets a visit from God himself in verse 12, &quot;And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.&quot; First, God gives Solomon the good news: do right by the One True God, and I will prosper you and your people forever (verses 13-18). The bad news: turn away from the One True God, and disaster will follow (verses 19-22). Here's an oft-quoted verse regarding Israel in verse 14, &quot;If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.&quot; Many preachers and evangelists use this as a verse for America. Since this was a specific promise to Israel based upon God's covenants with Israel, do you think it removes this verse from proper context to use it as a promise to America?</p>
<p><b>II Chronicles 7:17-20 needs some special attention:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>17 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments; <br>
				18 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel. <br>
				19 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; <br>
				20 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations. </p>

		<p>Ironically, Solomon's reign marks the beginning of a slide away from God. We see this clear statement of fact in <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="4-16.html#Warn" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 29-30 (see notes)</a>. The prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea and Amos) had all prophesied that God would restore the kingdom to Israel per the conditions of the Davidic Covenant.</p>

		<p>This is a preferred way for several of the Psalms to begin. See these words in 106:1; 107:1; 118:1. This unknown Psalmist also recounts all the victories and provisions given Israel by God. And then we see the phrase, &quot;for his mercy endureth for ever.&quot; Solomon may not have written these words, but they're certainly used this day in II Chronicles 5:13, 7:3 and 7:6 as part of the temple dedication.</p>
	<p><b>Following is a brief outline of Psalm 136:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>A call to praise (verses 1-3)
			<li>God&#146;s power as seen in nature (verses 4-9)
			<li>God's work in the history of Israel (verses 10-22)
			<li>God's mercy toward all (verses 23-26)
