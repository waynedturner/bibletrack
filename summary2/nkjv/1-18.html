		    2 	&ldquo;Do you think this is right?<br>
Do you say,<br>
&lsquo;My righteousness is more than God&rsquo;s&rsquo;? <br>
3 	For you say,<br>
&ldquo;What advantage will it be to You?<br>
What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?&rsquo; <br>
4 	&ldquo;I will answer you,<br>
And your companions with you. <br>
5 	Look to the heavens and see;<br>
And behold the clouds&mdash;<br>
They are higher than you. <br>
6 	If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him?<br>
Or, if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him? <br>
7 	If you are righteous, what do you give Him?<br>
Or what does He receive from your hand? <br>
8 	Your wickedness affects a man such as you,<br>
And your righteousness a son of man. <br>
9 	&ldquo;Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;<br>
They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty. <br>
10 	But no one says, &ldquo;Where is God my Maker,<br>
Who gives songs in the night, <br>
11 	Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth,<br>
And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?&rsquo; <br>
12 	There they cry out, but He does not answer,<br>
Because of the pride of evil men. <br>
13 	Surely God will not listen to empty talk,<br>
Nor will the Almighty regard it. <br>
14 	Although you say you do not see Him,<br>
Yet justice is before Him, and you must wait for Him. <br>
15 	And now, because He has not punished in His anger,<br>
Nor taken much notice of folly, <br>
16 	Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain;<br>
He multiplies words without knowledge.&rdquo; </font></p>

	<p>Elihu began this long monologue back in <a title="Job 32 Summary" href="1-16.html#Angry" target="_blank">Job 32 (see notes)</a>. This is is the only time we hear him speak. Don't you just hate it when somebody argues with you by misquoting what you said and then attacking that point? <font size="3">That's exactly what Elihu had done in chapters 33 and 34; now he's at it again. In verses 2 and 3 he seems to suggest that Job had indicated his righteousness was greater than that of God's. <b>Job never said that! </b>He also seems to suggest that Job had included the concept that sinning was no big deal in these two verses. With those inaccuracies as his springboard, he continues his condemnation of  Job - a condemnation that is basically misdirected, because <b>Job never said that either</b>. He tops it all off by dismissing Job's monologues completely in verse 16 when he says, &quot;Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain; He multiplies words without knowledge.&quot; That seems to be the inflammatory equivalent of, &quot;Job, you're just blowing hot air!&quot;<b> Make no mistake about it, Elihu is not part of the solution here, but a very confusing part of the problem.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Elihu, how arrogant can one be? (Job 36)</b></font><font size="3"><br>
				</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1  Elihu also proceeded and said: <br>
    2 	&ldquo;Bear with me a little, and I will show you<br>
That there are yet words to speak on God&rsquo;s behalf. <br>
3 	I will fetch my knowledge from afar;<br>
I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. <br>
4 	For truly my words are not false;<br>
One who is perfect in knowledge is with you. <br>
5 	&ldquo;Behold, God is mighty, but despises no one;<br>
He is mighty in strength of understanding. <br>
6 	He does not preserve the life of the wicked,<br>
But gives justice to the oppressed. <br>
7 	He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous;<br>
But they are on the throne with kings,<br>
For He has seated them forever,<br>
And they are exalted. <br>
8 	And if they are bound in fetters,<br>
Held in the cords of affliction, <br>
9 	Then He tells them their work and their transgressions&mdash;<br>
That they have acted defiantly. <br>
10 	He also opens their ear to instruction,<br>
And commands that they turn from iniquity. <br>
11 	If they obey and serve Him,<br>
They shall spend their days in prosperity,<br>
And their years in pleasures. <br>
12 	But if they do not obey,<br>
They shall perish by the sword,<br>
And they shall die without knowledge. <br>
13 	&ldquo;But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath;<br>
They do not cry for help when He binds them. <br>
14 	They die in youth,<br>
And their life ends among the perverted persons. <br>
15 	He delivers the poor in their affliction,<br>
And opens their ears in oppression. <br>
16 	&ldquo;Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress,<br>
Into a broad place where there is no restraint;<br>
And what is set on your table would be full of richness. <br>
17 	But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked;<br>
Judgment and justice take hold of you.<br>
18 	Because there is wrath, beware lest He take you away with one blow;<br>
For a large ransom would not help you avoid it.<br>
19 	Will your riches,<br>
Or all the mighty forces,<br>
Keep you from distress? <br>
20 	Do not desire the night,<br>
When people are cut off in their place. <br>
21 	Take heed, do not turn to iniquity,<br>
For you have chosen this rather than affliction. <br>
22 	&ldquo;Behold, God is exalted by His power;<br>
Who teaches like Him? <br>
23 	Who has assigned Him His way,<br>
Or who has said, &ldquo;You have done wrong&rsquo;? <br>
24 	&ldquo;Remember to magnify His work,<br>
Of which men have sung. <br>
25 	Everyone has seen it;<br>
Man looks on it from afar. <br>
26 	&ldquo;Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him;<br>
Nor can the number of His years be discovered. <br>
27 	For He draws up drops of water,<br>
Which distill as rain from the mist, <br>
28 	Which the clouds drop down<br>
And pour abundantly on man. <br>
29 	Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of clouds,<br>
The thunder from His canopy? <br>
30 	Look, He scatters His light upon it,<br>
And covers the depths of the sea. <br>
31 	For by these He judges the peoples;<br>
He gives food in abundance. <br>
32 	He covers His hands with lightning,<br>
And commands it to strike. <br>
33 	His thunder declares it,<br>
The cattle also, concerning the rising storm.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Look at Job 36:4, &quot;For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.&quot; Who is he talking about here when he proclaims that Job is in the presence of someone with perfect knowledge from God?<b> Elihu is referring to himself!</b> <b>Does this guy have an ego problem or what! </b>We know from <a title="Job 38 Summary" href="1-19.html#Top" target="_blank">Job 38-39 (see notes)</a> that his words aren't any more correct than the others who spoke to Job. <b>Come to think of it, I've met this guy</b> (so to speak)<b>. He's the would-be counselor who can't get his own affairs in order, but is determined to blast others with advice.</b> Look at verses 11 and 12, &quot;If they obey and serve Him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.  But if they do not obey, They shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.&quot; That's the same lame theology that has dominated everyone's thinking, that God rewards righteousness and punishes evil. Therefore, Job, you must be evil. <b>He obviously knows no more about God than Job's three friends.</b> One more thing, Job's three friends were satisfied with hitting Job with innuendo and glancing blows - not Elihu. <b>He goes right for the throat.</b> Look at verse 17, &quot;But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold of you.&quot;<b> Elihu is right in Job's face.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Elihu can go on, can't he? (Job 37</b></font><font size="3">)<br>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1  &ldquo;At this also my heart trembles,<br>
And leaps from its place. <br>
2 	Hear attentively the thunder of His voice,<br>
And the rumbling that comes from His mouth. <br>
3 	He sends it forth under the whole heaven,<br>
His lightning to the ends of the earth. <br>
4 	After it a voice roars;<br>
He thunders with His majestic voice,<br>
And He does not restrain them when His voice is heard. <br>
5 	God thunders marvelously with His voice;<br>
He does great things which we cannot comprehend. <br>
6 	For He says to the snow, &ldquo;Fall on the earth&rsquo;;<br>
Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength. <br>
7 	He seals the hand of every man,<br>
That all men may know His work. <br>
8 	The beasts go into dens,<br>
And remain in their lairs. <br>
9 	From the chamber of the south comes the whirlwind,<br>
And cold from the scattering winds of the north.<br>
10 	By the breath of God ice is given,<br>
And the broad waters are frozen. <br>
11 	Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds;<br>
He scatters His bright clouds. <br>
12 	And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance,<br>
That they may do whatever He commands them<br>
On the face of the whole earth. <br>
13 	He causes it to come,<br>
Whether for correction,<br>
Or for His land,<br>
Or for mercy. <br>
14 	&ldquo;Listen to this, O Job;<br>
Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God. <br>
15 	Do you know when God dispatches them,<br>
And causes the light of His cloud to shine? <br>
16 	Do you know how the clouds are balanced,<br>
Those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge? <br>
17 	Why are your garments hot,<br>
When He quiets the earth by the south wind?<br>
18 	With Him, have you spread out the skies,<br>
Strong as a cast metal mirror? <br>
19 	&ldquo;Teach us what we should say to Him,<br>
For we can prepare nothing because of the darkness. <br>
20 	Should He be told that I wish to speak?<br>
If a man were to speak, surely he would be swallowed up. <br>
21 	Even now men cannot look at the light when it is bright in the skies,<br>
When the wind has passed and cleared them. <br>
22 	He comes from the north as golden splendor;<br>
With God is awesome majesty. <br>
23 	As for the Almighty, we cannot find Him;<br>
He is excellent in power,<br>
In judgment and abundant justice;<br>
He does not oppress. <br>
24 	Therefore men fear Him;<br>
He shows no partiality to any who are wise of heart.&rdquo; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">He just spends this chapter waxing eloquent on the power qualities of God. He's definitely in Job's face; look at verse 14, &quot;Listen to this, O Job; Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God.&quot; Here's this young man spouting off and calling Job by name in his monologue. However, there's no news here. It is worth noting the last verse of this chapter, verse 24, &quot;Therefore men fear Him; He shows no partiality to any who are wise of heart.&quot; This seems to be another obvious dig at Job and his perception of his own righteousness and wisdom.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" title="Job 42 Summary"><b>Here's the mystery about Elihu's six-chapter monologue. He is no more correct in his assessment of Job's situation than Eliphaz, Bildad or Zophar. Yet, in <a href="1-20.html#Friends"> (see notes)</a><b>, those three are required to offer sacrifices before Job for their part in scolding Job with bad counsel (42:7). </b>Elihu was equally as wrong, but no such mention of consequences is made regarding him. Why? I don't know. To me, it seems impossible to vindicate him based upon an analysis of his words in these last six chapters. He argued the same incorrect points as did the others. Let's consider a couple of possible answers to this question. First of all, maybe it was because the three &quot;friends&quot; verbally attacked Job over a period of time (perhaps weeks or months), while Elihu gave only one speech just before God spoke. But here's a second possibility that I like a little better: Maybe Elihu was employed in some way by the other three to reason with Job - a professional mouth piece (so to speak). He doesn't introduce new concepts in his speech; he just restates in different words what has already been incorrectly stated by the three friends. If he's serving as an agent of the other three, that would explain why he does not seem to be held accountable in chapter 42 by God alongside them. <b>Whatever...two things are certain: Elihu misspoke, and no mention is made of repercussions against him by God for having done so.</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Well...hang on for the correct assessment of Job's situation. God begins speaking in </b><a title="Job 38 Summary" href="1-19.html#Top" target="_blank"><b>Job 38 </b>(see notes)</a><b>.</b></font></p>
