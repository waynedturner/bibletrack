    <p><font size="4"><b>Job picks a good time to remain silent (Job 40:1-5)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1  Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said: <br>
		    2 	&ldquo;Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him?<br>
He who rebukes God, let him answer it.&rdquo; <br>
3 Then Job answered the LORD and said: <br>
4 	&ldquo;Behold, I am vile;<br>
What shall I answer You?<br>
I lay my hand over my mouth. <br>
5 	Once I have spoken, but I will not answer;<br>
Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.&rdquo; <br>
		  </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>God began speaking here in <a title="Job 38 Summary" href="1-19.html#Top" target="_blank">Job 38 (see notes)</a>. <b>Job's never heard anything like this before according to 42:5 - God literally speaking to a man.</b> <font size="3">God pauses as he speaks from the whirlwind to make a comment on Job's previous monologues in verse 2, &quot;Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him? He who rebukes God, let him answer it.&quot; <b>Nope! A reply simply wouldn't be appropriate or prudent here.</b> Job immediately realizes that now would be the right time to remain silent and just let God speak. <b>Who would want to be seen &quot;contending&quot; or &quot;reproving&quot; God? </b></font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Let's remember something here; all of this started in chapter 1 when <b>God speaks of Job to Satan in </b><a title="Job 1 Summary" href="1-6.html#Fear" target="_blank"><b>Job 1:8</b> (see notes)</a><b>,</b> &quot;Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?&quot; However, this &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;upright&quot; man has made some statements in the course of his monologues that strike us as...well...maybe a little disrespectful toward God. Admittedly, Job's trial had made him a very confused man, and confused men say outrageous things under pressure. Job's comments along the way are quite provocative, but NOT sinful. Job wanted to hear God speak; well...hear ya go, Job! </font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>God continues expressing dissatisfaction with Job's comments (Job 40:6-14)</b></font><font size="3"><br>
				</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">6 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said: <br>
7 	&ldquo;Now prepare yourself like a man;<br>
I will question you, and you shall answer Me: <br>
8 	&ldquo;Would you indeed annul My judgment?<br>
Would you condemn Me that you may be justified? <br>
9 	Have you an arm like God?<br>
Or can you thunder with a voice like His? <br>
10 	Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor,<br>
And array yourself with glory and beauty. <br>
11 	Disperse the rage of your wrath;<br>
Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him. <br>
12 	Look on everyone who is proud, and bring him low;<br>
Tread down the wicked in their place. <br>
13 	Hide them in the dust together,<br>
Bind their faces in hidden darkness.<br>
14 	Then I will also confess to you<br>
That your own right hand can save you. <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">If you recall, Job spent considerable time expressing his belief that he was unjustifiably being abused and even appeared to question God's right to allow him to be treated in such a manner. Job apparently had little or no more understanding of trial than his friends. Therefore, he demanded a hearing before God to make his case. Well, now he has God's attention as God speaks. A rhetorical question in verse 8 is better not answered by Job, &quot;Would you indeed annul My judgment? Would you condemn Me that you may be justified?&quot; In other words, <b>is it proper to redefine God for one's own justification?</b> Think about those implications. Better yet,<b> how many people today have redefined their concept of God for their own perverted purposes.</b> That may impress ignorant people, but <b>God and God's people remain unimpressed with those who seek to vindicate their own rebellion against God's Word by perverting the counsel of God to do so.</b> Spiritually-minded/scripturally informed people will see through that heresy. Verses 6-14 contrast Job's feeble abilities to those of God. In other words, Job, if you had &quot;an arm like God&quot; (verse 9), then let's see what you can do.</font></p>
<p><b>What was this trial all about?</b> There is no question about the righteousness of Job before God. That's confirmed in the very first chapter.<b> Job is not being chastised for disobedience</b> as Job's counselors had suggested. However, we do see in Job a man who lacks an understanding of God's ways. Moreover, it's not like Job didn't have some things in his life that needed some work. <b>We saw in </b><a title="Job 29 Summary" href="1-15.html#Top" target="_blank"><b>Job 29 </b>(see notes)</a><b> what a proud man Job was before the current round of adversity.</b> Well...NO MORE! That pride is gone and Job is all ears as God speaks now. This bout of trials makes Job an all-new, willing vessel for God. And you know...<b>that's what trial does; it doesn't come upon Believers because of rebellion against God, but rather to sharpen us and make us more usable for God's purposes.</b></p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>What in the world is a Behemoth? (Job 40:15-24)</b></font><font size="3"><br>
		</font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">15 	&ldquo;Look now at the behemoth, which I made along with you;<br>
He eats grass like an ox. <br>
16 	See now, his strength is in his hips,<br>
And his power is in his stomach muscles. <br>
17 	He moves his tail like a cedar;<br>
The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit. <br>
18 	His bones are like beams of bronze,<br>
His ribs like bars of iron. <br>
19 	He is the first of the ways of God;<br>
Only He who made him can bring near His sword. <br>
20 	Surely the mountains yield food for him,<br>
And all the beasts of the field play there. <br>
21 	He lies under the lotus trees,<br>
In a covert of reeds and marsh. <br>
22 	The lotus trees cover him with their shade;<br>
The willows by the brook surround him. <br>
23 	Indeed the river may rage,<br>
Yet he is not disturbed;<br>
He is confident, though the Jordan gushes into his mouth, <br>
24 	Though he takes it in his eyes,<br>
Or one pierces his nose with a snare. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><font size="3">God uses an illustration from nature when he describes the Behemoth. It's a transliterated Hebrew word (pronounced the same way in Hebrew). But don't get too excited over a potential discovery of an extinct creature; this is the only reference to it and probably is describing a hippopotamus; there's no way to tell for certain - just a very large animal that's a vegetarian. To summarize the point of its mention, a hippopotamus is hard to hunt with the tools available in Job's time - too big, clunky, powerful and thick-skinned. It's the kind of animal that you just stand in awe as you observe and then leave it alone.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>And then there's the Leviathan (Job 41)</b></font><font size="3"><br>
				</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1  &ldquo;Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook,<br>
Or snare his tongue with a line which you lower? <br>
2 	Can you put a reed through his nose,<br>
Or pierce his jaw with a hook? <br>
3 	Will he make many supplications to you?<br>
Will he speak softly to you? <br>
4 	Will he make a covenant with you?<br>
Will you take him as a servant forever? <br>
5 	Will you play with him as with a bird,<br>
Or will you leash him for your maidens? <br>
6 	Will your companions make a banquet of him?<br>
Will they apportion him among the merchants? <br>
7 	Can you fill his skin with harpoons,<br>
Or his head with fishing spears? <br>
8 	Lay your hand on him;<br>
Remember the battle&mdash;<br>
Never do it again! <br>
9 	Indeed, any hope of overcoming him is false;<br>
Shall one not be overwhelmed at the sight of him? <br>
10 	No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.<br>
Who then is able to stand against Me? <br>
11 	Who has preceded Me, that I should pay him?<br>
Everything under heaven is Mine. <br>
12 	&ldquo;I will not conceal his limbs,<br>
His mighty power, or his graceful proportions. <br>
13 	Who can remove his outer coat?<br>
Who can approach him with a double bridle? <br>
14 	Who can open the doors of his face,<br>
With his terrible teeth all around? <br>
15 	His rows of scales are his pride,<br>
Shut up tightly as with a seal; <br>
16 	One is so near another<br>
That no air can come between them; <br>
17 	They are joined one to another,<br>
They stick together and cannot be parted. <br>
18 	His sneezings flash forth light,<br>
And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. <br>
19 	Out of his mouth go burning lights;<br>
Sparks of fire shoot out. <br>
20 	Smoke goes out of his nostrils,<br>
As from a boiling pot and burning rushes. <br>
21 	His breath kindles coals,<br>
And a flame goes out of his mouth. <br>
22 	Strength dwells in his neck,<br>
And sorrow dances before him. <br>
23 	The folds of his flesh are joined together;<br>
They are firm on him and cannot be moved. <br>
24 	His heart is as hard as stone,<br>
Even as hard as the lower millstone.<br>
25 	When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid;<br>
Because of his crashings they are beside themselves. <br>
26 	Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail;<br>
Nor does spear, dart, or javelin. <br>
27 	He regards iron as straw,<br>
And bronze as rotten wood. <br>
28 	The arrow cannot make him flee;<br>
Slingstones become like stubble to him. <br>
29 	Darts are regarded as straw;<br>
He laughs at the threat of javelins. <br>
30 	His undersides are like sharp potsherds;<br>
He spreads pointed marks in the mire. <br>
31 	He makes the deep boil like a pot;<br>
He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. <br>
32 	He leaves a shining wake behind him;<br>
One would think the deep had white hair. <br>
33 	On earth there is nothing like him,<br>
Which is made without fear. <br>
34 	He beholds every high thing;<br>
He is king over all the children of pride.&rdquo; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3"><b>Whoa! Here's a whole chapter devoted to the magnificent (and terrifying) attributes of an extinct animal.</b> At least, <b>let's hope it's extinct!</b> Easton's Bible Dictionary has this definition of the word </font><font size="3"><b>Leviathan</b>: &quot;a transliterated Hebrew word (livyathan), meaning 'twisted,' 'coiled.'&quot; Well, that didn't help us much. However, when you look at the description of the creature given in this chapter, what do you get? Well, let me just say, I've been to the San Diego Zoo; it's a remarkable place, but they don't have one of these...thankfully! <b>What's the point here for even mentioning this creature?</b> Answer: God created this awesome animal. Who dares to presume to instruct or rebuke the creator of such an awesome creature. <b>Many scholars suggest that this is a crocodile. </b>Well...maybe...<b>but then you have verses 19-21 - the fire thing out of his nose and mouth; I've never seen a crocodile do that. Have you?</b> It's more than likely a description of an extinct animal. <b>Whatever, stay out of the water!</b></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Job"></a>Job finally comes up with something for which to repent (Job 42:1-6)</b></font><font size="3"><br>
</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1  Then Job answered the LORD and said: <br>
    2 	&ldquo;I know that You can do everything,<br>
And that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You. <br>
3 	You asked, &ldquo;Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?&rsquo;<br>
Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,<br>
Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. <br>
4 	Listen, please, and let me speak;<br>
You said, &ldquo;I will question you, and you shall answer Me.&rsquo; <br>
5 	&ldquo;I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear,<br>
But now my eye sees You. <br>
6 	Therefore I abhor myself,<br>
And repent in dust and ashes.&rdquo; <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Job replies...carefully. Keep in mind, this trial did not happen to Job because of sin in Job's life. However, Job does recognize where he has stepped over the line in this process when he says in verse 3, &quot;Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?&rsquo; Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.<b>&quot;</b> I've done that on occasion myself; how about you? <b>Hey Bildad, Eliphaz and Zophar...are you still looking for some sort of an admission of guilt and a repentance from Job?</b> Here it is in verses 5 and 6, &quot;I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, But now my eye sees You.  Therefore I abhor myself, And repent in dust and ashes.&quot; <b>He repents for the mere notion that he could possibly question God's motivation, attributes or character.</b> How's that for a remedy to the pride Job displayed in </font><a title="Job 29 Summary" href="1-15.html#Top" target="_blank"><b>Job 29 </b>(see notes)</a><font size="3">. <b>There's nothing like realizing that we're nothing compared to God or without God.</b> Maybe it doesn't seem like much to you, but <b>this realization will change a Believer's life.</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Now...let's put this whole episode in perspective:</b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember Satan's challenge to God in <a title="Job 1 Summary" href="1-6.html#Fear" target="_blank">Job 1:11 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!&quot;
			<li>God permitted Satan to destroy most of Job's possessions, but Job did not curse God.
			<li>Satan issued a second challenge to God in <a title="Job 2 Summary" href="1-6.html#Satisfied" target="_blank">Job 2:5 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!&quot;
			<li>Job's wife even became part of the problem in <a title="Job 2 Summary" href="1-6.html#Satisfied" target="_blank">Job 2:9 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Then his wife said to him, &ldquo;Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!&quot; You will note that her counsel to her husband was precisely what Satan had assumed as his mission.
			<li>Throughout Job's ordeal, he never once entertained the idea that he might &quot;curse God.&quot; All of his friends were of the belief that Job must have sinned; Job knew that he had not.
			<li>In the end, Job maintained his integrity all the way through, yet he does admit to God in Job 42:3, &quot;...Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.&quot;
		</ul>
	<p><font size="3">Mission accomplished! It was a tough road, but <b>Job DID NOT curse God, and Job DID maintain his integrity, much to the dismay of Satan (1:11, 2:5) and Job's wife (2:9).</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="3"><b>Job's trial was a character-building ordeal. It's the same process by which Believers are made strong and capable today. Read these two articles to grasp this concept:</b></font></p>
		<ul>

			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p><a name="Friends"></a><font size="4"><b>What about Job's misguided friends? (Job 42:7-9)</b></font><font size="3"><br>
				</font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">7 And so it was, after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, &ldquo;My wrath is aroused against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.<br>
8 Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you according to your folly; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.&rdquo; <br>
9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD commanded them; for the LORD had accepted Job. <br>
		  </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><font size="3">Chapter after chapter Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar have irritated us with their homemade theology and rebukes against Job. Now it's time for these three to get what's coming to them. And, yes, I'm a little disappointed that there is no mention of Elihu here. He irritated me also - perhaps more than any of the others. I still cling to the understanding that the first comments of God from the whirlwind were right on the tail of Elihu's comments. Surely he felt strongly rebuked and embarrassed as his speech was immediately discounted by God in front of his whole audience. If that doesn't cause you to lose audience credibility, what does? </font></p>
		<p><font size="3">Take a look at God's decree regarding the counselors;<b> they must make their sacrifices before Job in verse 8 and have Job pray for them.</b> <b>In other words, not only did God take offense to their false counsel, but their offense was against Job as well. Job's forgiveness of these counselors was a critical piece of their restoration.</b> Isn't that interesting; off-the-top-of-the-head, but baseless counsel of another requires of them a sin sacrifice. Think about how Christians today throw around counsel based upon only an uninformed hunch. <b>Maybe we should learn a lesson here about giving counsel: Make certain it's based upon scripture.</b> Their incorrect counsel in the name of God earns them the standing of being sinners in need of forgiveness by God and from the very man upon whom they thrust their bogus counsel.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>A happy ending - Job is restored (Job 42:10-17)</b></font><font size="3"><br>
	</font></p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">10 And the LORD restored Job&rsquo;s losses when he prayed for his friends. Indeed the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. <br>
11 Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the LORD had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold. <br>
12 Now the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys. <br>
13 He also had seven sons and three daughters. <br>
14 And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. <br>
15 In all the land were found no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. <br>
16 After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren for four generations. <br>
17 So Job died, old and full of days. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><font size="3">I would have liked to have had a couple of chapters devoted to Job's restoration - you know, as a personal reward to make up for all the depressing chapters. However, the important point is made, <b>God restored him completely, and he experienced greater prosperity than before.</b> So, what about <b>Job's friends and relatives?</b> You know...the ones who were noticeably silent when they thought their friend, Job, was being judged by God? <b>Well, now that God has spoken and expressed his favor toward Job, they're back...and with gifts!</b> Isn't it funny how prosperity seems to attract friends? </font></p>
	<p><font size="3">At first reading, there was one big unsettled issue in my mind - <b>Job's wife</b> - you remember...the one who told Job in </font><a title="Job 2 Summary" href="1-6.html#Satisfied" target="_blank">Job 2:9 (see notes)</a><font size="3"> to &quot;curse God, and die.&quot; <b>Should she get out of this thing unscathed?</b> Then I realized that she really didn't. Look at Job 42:13, &quot;He also had seven sons and three daughters.&quot; <b>Despite the fact that she bore and had raised 10 children to adulthood before, it would appear that, even as an older woman, she had to do it all over again another 10 times</b>; I'm good with that!</font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>CONSIDER THIS:</b> The Book of Job provides us with our basis for understanding the purpose and course of trial in the lives of Believers. It is an important doctrinal book for Believers. <b>What is taught about trial in the New Testament is founded on the principles found right here in the Book of Job.</b></font></p>
