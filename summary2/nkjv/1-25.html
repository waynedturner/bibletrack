<p>The setting for this occasion is somewhere in Galilee. <font size="3"><b>Leprosy was the dreaded disease of Bible times</b> in both the Old and New Testaments. The Law of Moses has much to say about the procedures for dealing with a person who has leprosy. He was considered unclean and placed away from the general populace in isolation. Furthermore, you couldn't just walk back into society one day and say, &quot;I'm all well now.&quot; You had to be declared clean and &quot;all well now&quot; by the priest. <b>This procedure is found in detail in <a title="Leprosy Summary" href="3-5.html#Leprosy" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> <b>After Jesus heals the leper, he tells him not to tell anyone how he was healed, but rather just show himself to the priest for the necessary clean bill of health.</b> Did he obey?

So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.&quot;</font></p>

		<p><font size="3">Jesus is up in northern Israel in Capernaum on the coast of the Sea of Galilee. While preaching in a house, people continued to gather around until some showed up with a paralytic man. It was too crowded to get him in, so <b>they lowered him through the roof. </b>No problems until <b>Jesus tells the paralytic man, &quot;...your sins are forgiven you.&quot;</b> The religion police (Pharisees and scribes) were there, and that raises a ruckus among the Jewish <b>scribes </b>(the official scholars); they accuse him of blasphemy. Of course, they're simply looking for something to use against Jesus, since he had already made it clear that he has <b>no respect for the corrupt Jewish leadership</b> of the day. It was problematic for them that Jesus had the ability to heal the sick, but <b>to forgive sins was over the line</b> as far as they were concerned. </font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Here's some insight on this situation. <b>There is no suggestion here that all sickness is as a result of sin.</b> However, as God in the flesh, Christ was able to perceive that this man's illness was as the result of sin; he also perceived that this paralytic man was repentant. Therefore, it was appropriate for him to forgive this man's sins. Meantime, <b>the scribes are looking for a way to entrap Jesus.</b> They would like to have had direct evidence that he had proclaimed himself to be God; they bait him to make that declaration in Mark 2:7 when they ask, &quot;Who can forgive sins but God alone?&quot; However, all they can get are implications as he refers to himself as the &quot;Son of man,&quot; a reference used by David and Ezekiel in a human context, but used by Daniel to refer to the Messiah.</font></p>
<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
			  <blockquote>
			    <p><font size="3" color="#000010"><a title="Daniel 7 Summary" href="12-12.html#Daniel" target="_blank">Daniel 7:13-14 (see notes)</a> I was watching in the night visions, 	And behold, One like the Son of Man, 	Coming with the clouds of heaven! 	He came to the Ancient of Days, 	And they brought Him near before Him.  Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, 	That all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. 	His dominion is an everlasting dominion, 	Which shall not pass away, 	And His kingdom the one 	Which shall not be destroyed. </font></p>
		      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
	<p><font size="3">So, without directly saying it, Jesus is assuming the title of Messiah...or is he? The title, &quot;Son of man,&quot; wasn't a reference to that same Messianic context in Ezekiel where it is used by that prophet 93 times in reference to himself. You can see how Jesus gave these religious professionals fits.</font></p>
	<p>Incidentally, not long before this incident, Jesus had declared that he, himself, was the Messiah while in a synagogue in Nazareth. That occasion is found in <a href="1-21.html#Jews" title="Luke 4 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 4:16-30 (see notes)</a> and was in Jesus' hometown. Capernaum, where this incident takes place is about 30 miles by roads from Nazareth. That's a considerable distance in a day when people walked where they went. It is likely that word from Nazareth had not trickled over to Capernaum about Jesus' professed identity at this point in time.</p>

		<p><font size="3">It's only natural that Jews hated tax collectors - representatives of the Roman government assigned to take their money - still true today, I guess. These tax gatherers are called &quot;publicans&quot; in the KJV. Jews really, really despised the Roman-appointed tax collectors...like Levi. He was a Jew and had a Jewish name, but worked for the government. It really grated on the Jews that Jesus would go have supper with him...and with his friends - fellow tax collectors. <b>Levi becomes one of the apostles of Jesus, and his name is changed to Matthew</b>. &quot;Matthew,&quot; by the way, is the English transliteration of the Greek transliteration for the Hebrew name, &quot;Mattithiah&quot; (the name of four men mentioned in the Old Testament). Furthermore, <b>he goes on to write the Gospel according to Matthew. </b></font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Matthew's own Gospel simply refers to the occasion as a meal, as does Mark. Both refer to the questionable guests as &quot;many tax collectors and sinners.&quot; Luke, however, identifies this occasion as a &quot;<strong>great feast</strong> in his own house. And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them.&quot; Luke wants us to understand the magnitude of the problem here as seen by the Jewish leaders. Perhaps this is a going-out-of-business bash that Matthew throws. As a practice, Pharisees had no contact with these &quot;sinners&quot; and question why Jesus chooses to do so. Jesus replies that ministering to sinners is why he came. <b>The Pharisees see this as a great opportunity to point out the shortcomings of Jesus to a lot of people; we'll see this in the verses that follow. </b>In Matthew 9:13, Matthew points out that Jesus quoted <a title="Hosea 6 Summary" href="1-29.html#Corn" title="Matthew 12 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 12:7 (see notes)</a>.</p>

		<p>In Luke's account we see this conversation taking place at Matthew's house on the occasion of his I-ain't-collectin'-taxes-anymore party. That's significant, inasmuch as the big ol' banquet tables are stacked with food (remember - a &quot;great feast&quot;). <b>So, with all this eating going on, how about a question regarding the indulgences of the occasion, &quot;Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?&quot;</b> Matthew and Mark both tell us that some of the disciples of John the Baptist participate with the Pharisees in this inquiry. (I just wonder if the Pharisees had been over talking to John's disciples trying to get them riled up.) As far as scripture is concerned, <font size="3">in the Old Testament the <b>Jews only fasted on the Day of Atonement</b> (<a title="Leviticus 16 Summary" href="4-19.html#Pharisees" title="Luke 18 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 18:12 (see notes)</a> that <b>some of the Pharisees fasted twice a week</b>; we have no idea why. As far as John the Baptist's disciples, maybe they were fasting because he was in prison at the time, or maybe they were fasting because they saw the Messianic age at hand; we don't really know. In both cases, <b>fasting was a sure sign in those times that you were serious about your religion.</b> </font>A complete overview regarding fasting can be seen in the commentary on <a href="10-9.html#Fasting" title="Isaiah 58 Summary" target="_blank">Isaiah 58 (see notes)</a>.</p>
	<p><font size="3">So, here's the question asked of Jesus: &quot;<b>Why don't your disciples fast?&quot;</b> The answer comes in the form of an analogy. When the bridegroom is present at the wedding feast, there's nothing to fast about; everybody eats heartily. However, when the bridegroom is gone, then it will be appropriate to fast. <b>Was he talking about his crucifixion here? </b></font>Perhaps so, but one thing is for certain: Jesus implies that the Pharisees and John's disciples fast in anticipation of an event ie. the coming of the Messiah. Since Jesus is that Messiah, his disciples have no need to fast. Incidentally, John the Baptist is in prison and has been since <a href="3-6.html#Background" target="_blank">Matthew 14:3-12 (see notes)</a> - perhaps another reason why his disciples fast.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>What is this new-wine-old-bottles analogy about? </b>Let's look at the circumstances and conversation around Jesus' comments and see if we can perceive his meaning. The Pharisees were the leading religionists in Palestine in that day. They fully anticipated that anyone aspiring to Messiahship would be working with them. Here they are at it again, however, criticizing every move Jesus makes - who his friends are, with whom he eats, the very fact that he eats at all. <b>So to explain to them where they fit into the leadership scheme of the coming kingdom, Jesus uses the wine-bottle and the cloth-garment analogies.</b></font></p>
	<p>Before we actually plug into our analogy, let's take a look at the underlying principle behind these two analogies. The KJV translates the adjective (Greek: ἄ&gamma;&nu;&alpha;&phi;&omicron;&sigmaf;/agnaphos) here as &quot;new.&quot; The word specifically means &quot;unshrunken.&quot; So, if you sew a new piece of cloth that has never been washed, the piece will shrink while the rest of the garment will not. That would be ugly. Likewise, the new wine cannot successfully be fermented in previously-used wineskins because they have already been stretched during the first fermentation process. Fermentation emits a gas which causes significant expansion. Therefore, the previously-used wineskin has no ability to stretch further, and thus, would break open.</p>
		<p><font size="3"><b>Let's fit the components into these two analogies:</b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font size="3">New wine = Messianic kingdom</font>
			<li><font size="3">Old bottles = Current corrupt leadership</font>
			<li><font size="3">New cloth = Messianic kingdom</font>
			<li><font size="3">Old garment = Current corrupt leadership</font>
		</ul>
		<p><font size="3"><b>Here's the bottom line subtly stated: Jesus is telling these Pharisees that they won't be part of the leadership team in the Messianic kingdom. Do you think they're starting to get the picture?</b></font></p>
