          <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;My soul loathes my life;<br>
I will give free course to my complaint,<br>
I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. <br>
2 	I will say to God, &ldquo;Do not condemn me;<br>
Show me why You contend with me. <br>
3 	Does it seem good to You that You should oppress,<br>
That You should despise the work of Your hands,<br>
And smile on the counsel of the wicked? <br>
4 	Do You have eyes of flesh?<br>
Or do You see as man sees? <br>
5 	Are Your days like the days of a mortal man?<br>
Are Your years like the days of a mighty man, <br>
6 	That You should seek for my iniquity<br>
And search out my sin, <br>
7 	Although You know that I am not wicked,<br>
And there is no one who can deliver from Your hand? <br>
8 	&ldquo;Your hands have made me and fashioned me,<br>
An intricate unity;<br>
Yet You would destroy me. <br>
9 	Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay.<br>
And will You turn me into dust again? <br>
10 	Did You not pour me out like milk,<br>
And curdle me like cheese, <br>
11 	Clothe me with skin and flesh,<br>
And knit me together with bones and sinews? <br>
12 	You have granted me life and favor,<br>
And Your care has preserved my spirit. <br>
13 	&ldquo;And these things You have hidden in Your heart;<br>
I know that this was with You: <br>
14 	If I sin, then You mark me,<br>
And will not acquit me of my iniquity. <br>
15 	If I am wicked, woe to me;<br>
Even if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head.<br>
I am full of disgrace;<br>
See my misery! <br>
16 	If my head is exalted,<br>
You hunt me like a fierce lion,<br>
And again You show Yourself awesome against me. <br>
17 	You renew Your witnesses against me,<br>
And increase Your indignation toward me;<br>
Changes and war are ever with me. <br>
18 	&ldquo;Why then have You brought me out of the womb?<br>
Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me! <br>
19 	I would have been as though I had not been.<br>
I would have been carried from the womb to the grave. <br>
20 	Are not my days few?<br>
Cease! Leave me alone, that I may take a little comfort, <br>
21 	Before I go to the place from which I shall not return,<br>
To the land of darkness and the shadow of death, <br>
22 	A land as dark as darkness itself,<br>
As the shadow of death, without any order,<br>
Where even the light is like darkness.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </font></p>

    <p><font size="3">This chapter is a continuation of Job's third speech which began in <a title="Job 9 Summary" href="1-6.html#Satisfied" target="_blank">For an outline of the Book of Job, click here.</a> Job's at it again - expressing unbearable grief. <b>Job's speech shifts gears in verse 2 as he appears to be addressing God himself with his thoughts.</b> As he cries out to God, it is interesting that he's not asking for healing or restoration; he just wants to know &quot;why!&quot; Maybe it's just me, but if I was covered with oozing sores, I'd be asking for a little physical healing, but Job (verse 2) is just intent on knowing - &quot;...Show me why You contend with me.&quot; The remainder of chapter 10 is Job addressing God in the presence of his friends. <b>So, let's go over the dilemma again: Job's theology (and that of his friends) consists of the doctrine that when bad things happen, it's because of sin; God is punishing.</b> </font></p>

        <p><font size="3"><b>This concept of trial, without the presence of sin, is a completely foreign doctrine to all of them.</b> Job's problem? He was a man who was meticulous about shunning sin and serving God.<b> In his mind, his theology of God has crash landed.</b> Now, from his friends' perspectives, <b>he must be a closet sinner</b> - a theory that even seems a little amusing to them; they seem to take a little pleasure in believing that goody-goody Job was, in reality, not as righteous as they thought. From Job's perspective, he's more interested in understanding his circumstances than physical restoration. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Nowhere in the whole book does Job ask God for healing or restoration - just answers.</b> In this chapter he presents himself as a marked man without hope. He doesn't feel he has a chance as we see in verse 16, &quot;You hunt me like a fierce lion, And again You show Yourself awesome against me.&quot; Then in verse 19 he does his death-wish routine again, &quot;I would have been as though I had not been. I would have been carried from the womb to the grave.&quot; </font></p>

    </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2">1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: <br>
        2 	&ldquo;Should not the multitude of words be answered?<br>
And should a man full of talk be vindicated? <br>
3 	Should your empty talk make men hold their peace?<br>
And when you mock, should no one rebuke you? <br>
4 	For you have said,<br>
&ldquo;My doctrine is pure,<br>
And I am clean in your eyes.&rsquo; <br>
5 	But oh, that God would speak,<br>
And open His lips against you, <br>
6 	That He would show you the secrets of wisdom!<br>
For they would double your prudence.<br>
Know therefore that God exacts from you<br>
Less than your iniquity deserves.<br>
7 	&ldquo;Can you search out the deep things of God?<br>
Can you find out the limits of the Almighty? <br>
8 	They are higher than heaven&mdash; what can you do?<br>
Deeper than Sheol&mdash; what can you know? <br>
9 	Their measure is longer than the earth<br>
And broader than the sea. <br>
10 	&ldquo;If He passes by, imprisons, and gathers to judgment,<br>
Then who can hinder Him? <br>
11 	For He knows deceitful men;<br>
He sees wickedness also.<br>
Will He not then consider it?<br>
12 	For an empty-headed man will be wise,<br>
When a wild donkey&rsquo;s colt is born a man. <br>
13 	&ldquo;If you would prepare your heart,<br>
And stretch out your hands toward Him; <br>
14 	If iniquity were in your hand, and you put it far away,<br>
And would not let wickedness dwell in your tents; <br>
15 	Then surely you could lift up your face without spot;<br>
Yes, you could be steadfast, and not fear; <br>
16 	Because you would forget your misery,<br>
And remember it as waters that have passed away, <br>
17 	And your life would be brighter than noonday.<br>
Though you were dark, you would be like the morning. <br>
18 	And you would be secure, because there is hope;<br>
Yes, you would dig around you, and take your rest in safety. <br>
19 	You would also lie down, and no one would make you afraid;<br>
Yes, many would court your favor. <br>
20 	But the eyes of the wicked will fail,<br>
And they shall not escape,<br>
And their hope&mdash;loss of life!&rdquo; </font></p>

    <p><font size="3">Here's a man who doesn't mince words; he goes right after Job - right to his integrity and truthfulness; it's Zophar's first speech to Job. In verses 1-2 he accuses Job of foolish talk and insists that Job should be shamed. In verse 3 he says, &quot;Should your empty talk make men hold their peace?&quot;<b> He just called Job a liar!</b> He disputes Job's righteousness and suggests that God himself should speak out against Job's sin; then everybody would know the truth about Job. Look at verse 11, &quot;For He knows deceitful men; He sees wickedness also. Will He not then consider it?&quot; Did he just suggest that Job is wicked and vain? This guy's a friend? He certainly can spin a put-down though; look at verse 12, &quot;For an empty-headed man will be wise, When a wild donkey&rsquo;s colt is born a man.&quot; Did he just label Job a witless, empty-headed man with as much chance to become wise as a wild donkey has to be born tame? <b>Here's the bottom line on chapter 11. Zophar eloquently tells Job to his face that he's a liar. Zophar's advice is clear in verses 13-14: all of Job's troubles will be behind him if he will just confess to sin and ask God for forgiveness.</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="2">1 Then Job answered and said: <br>
    2 	&ldquo;No doubt you are the people,<br>
And wisdom will die with you! <br>
3 	But I have understanding as well as you;<br>
I am not inferior to you.<br>
Indeed, who does not know such things as these? <br>
4 	&ldquo;I am one mocked by his friends,<br>
Who called on God, and He answered him,<br>
The just and blameless who is ridiculed. <br>
5 	A lamp is despised in the thought of one who is at ease;<br>
It is made ready for those whose feet slip. <br>
6 	The tents of robbers prosper,<br>
And those who provoke God are secure&mdash;<br>
In what God provides by His hand. <br>
7 	&ldquo;But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you;<br>
And the birds of the air, and they will tell you; <br>
8 	Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you;<br>
And the fish of the sea will explain to you. <br>
9 	Who among all these does not know<br>
That the hand of the LORD has done this, <br>
10 	In whose hand is the life of every living thing,<br>
And the breath of all mankind? <br>
11 	Does not the ear test words<br>
And the mouth taste its food? <br>
12 	Wisdom is with aged men,<br>
And with length of days, understanding. <br>
13 	&ldquo;With Him are wisdom and strength,<br>
He has counsel and understanding. <br>
14 	If He breaks a thing down, it cannot be rebuilt;<br>
If He imprisons a man, there can be no release. <br>
15 	If He withholds the waters, they dry up;<br>
If He sends them out, they overwhelm the earth. <br>
16 	With Him are strength and prudence.<br>
The deceived and the deceiver are His. <br>
17 	He leads counselors away plundered,<br>
And makes fools of the judges. <br>
18 	He loosens the bonds of kings,<br>
And binds their waist with a belt. <br>
19 	He leads princes away plundered,<br>
And overthrows the mighty. <br>
20 	He deprives the trusted ones of speech,<br>
And takes away the discernment of the elders. <br>
21 	He pours contempt on princes,<br>
And disarms the mighty. <br>
22 	He uncovers deep things out of darkness,<br>
And brings the shadow of death to light. <br>
23 	He makes nations great, and destroys them;<br>
He enlarges nations, and guides them. <br>
24 	He takes away the understanding of the chiefs of the people of the earth,<br>
And makes them wander in a pathless wilderness. <br>
25 	They grope in the dark without light,<br>
And He makes them stagger like a drunken man.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Here's Job's response to Zophar's speech of chapter 11; this speech (Job's fourth) goes all the way through chapter 14. I like verse 2, &quot;No doubt you are the people, And wisdom will die with you!&quot; In other words, Job sarcastically replies, &quot;You guys think that you are the only wise people in the world!&quot; Nice cut, Job! Job is quick to point out that he is not inferior to them in the knowledge of God. He still maintains his innocence in verse 4, &quot;I am one mocked by his friends, Who called on God, and He answered him, The just and blameless who is ridiculed.&quot; He goes on to point out in verse 6 that idolaters and sinners are prospering while he, a righteous man, is suffering. Then he spends the rest of this chapter extolling God. He seems to be saying that God's ways are way too complex to be presented with the simplicity he's hearing from his friends. <b>He doesn't have the answer to his suffering, but he's certain that his friends don't either.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Job lashes out at his friends and their senseless counsel (Job 13)</b></font><font size="3"><br>
				</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;Behold, my eye has seen all this,<br>
My ear has heard and understood it. <br>
2 	What you know, I also know;<br>
I am not inferior to you. <br>
3 	But I would speak to the Almighty,<br>
And I desire to reason with God. <br>
4 	But you forgers of lies,<br>
You are all worthless physicians. <br>
5 	Oh, that you would be silent,<br>
And it would be your wisdom! <br>
6 	Now hear my reasoning,<br>
And heed the pleadings of my lips. <br>
7 	Will you speak wickedly for God,<br>
And talk deceitfully for Him? <br>
8 	Will you show partiality for Him?<br>
Will you contend for God? <br>
9 	Will it be well when He searches you out?<br>
Or can you mock Him as one mocks a man? <br>
10 	He will surely rebuke you<br>
If you secretly show partiality. <br>
11 	Will not His excellence make you afraid,<br>
And the dread of Him fall upon you? <br>
12 	Your platitudes are proverbs of ashes,<br>
Your defenses are defenses of clay. <br>
13 	&ldquo;Hold your peace with me, and let me speak,<br>
Then let come on me what may!<br>
14 	Why do I take my flesh in my teeth,<br>
And put my life in my hands? <br>
15 	Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him.<br>
Even so, I will defend my own ways before Him. <br>
16 	He also shall be my salvation,<br>
For a hypocrite could not come before Him. <br>
17 	Listen carefully to my speech,<br>
And to my declaration with your ears. <br>
18 	See now, I have prepared my case,<br>
I know that I shall be vindicated. <br>
19 	Who is he who will contend with me?<br>
If now I hold my tongue, I perish. <br>
20 	&ldquo;Only two things do not do to me,<br>
Then I will not hide myself from You: <br>
21 	Withdraw Your hand far from me,<br>
And let not the dread of You make me afraid. <br>
22 	Then call, and I will answer;<br>
Or let me speak, then You respond to me. <br>
23 	How many are my iniquities and sins?<br>
Make me know my transgression and my sin. <br>
24 	Why do You hide Your face,<br>
And regard me as Your enemy? <br>
25 	Will You frighten a leaf driven to and fro?<br>
And will You pursue dry stubble? <br>
26 	For You write bitter things against me,<br>
And make me inherit the iniquities of my youth. <br>
27 	You put my feet in the stocks,<br>
And watch closely all my paths.<br>
You set a limit for the soles of my feet. <br>
28 	&ldquo;Man decays like a rotten thing,<br>
Like a garment that is moth-eaten. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Here's a  continuation of the speech Job began in chapter 12. Here, he makes reference to all his friends sitting around and giving advice about which they know nothing. In verse 2 he points out, <b>&quot;You guys don't know anything that I don't know!&quot;</b> Given the opportunity (verse 3), he felt he could prove his case before God. Hey! Job! Tell us what you really think about the advice you're getting from your friends! <b>Job 13:4, &quot;But you forgers of lies, You are all worthless physicians.&quot;</b> <b>Obviously, Job is just a little irritated with his friends - wouldn't you say?</b> He gently tells them to &quot;shut up&quot; in verse 5? </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>What a testimony in verse 15, &quot;Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him. Even so, I will defend my own ways before Him.&quot;</b> No matter what happens, Job will serve God. When you contrast that statement to Satan's mission here, that verse takes on new meaning. Recall from <a href="1-10.html#Top" target="_blank">Job 14 (see notes)</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#a50000"><b>Here's the lesson of these 4 chapters...and the whole book for that matter: DON'T GUESS WHEN YOU ARE GIVING COUNSEL TO OTHERS! </b>It turns out that these so-called counselors were DEAD WRONG! One valuable outcome from reading the Book of Job should be that we will take great care in making certain that any counsel we offer is completely scriptural.<br>
