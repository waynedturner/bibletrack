<p><font size="4"><b>Who wrote James?<br>
				</b></font><font size="3">James, according to many scholars, may be one of the earliest letters to Believers in the New Testament. Even though there were two other men named &quot;James&quot; who were Apostles of Christ (<a href="8-1.html#Paul" target="_blank">Acts 21 (see notes)</a> in those Jerusalem councils. The Jewish historian, Josephus, reports that James was martyred around 62 A.D. If that's the case, then the Book of James would have been written prior to that time. </font></p>
<p>The absence of any reference to Gentile Believers in the Book of James causes us to place this letter before the Jerusalem Council in <font size="3"><a title="Acts 15 Summary" href="7-24.html#Price" target="_blank">Acts 15 (see notes)</a></font>. James is writing to &quot;the twelve tribes&quot; here (Jewish Christians)  and refers to their gathering place as a &quot;synagogue&quot; rather than a &quot;church&quot; in James 2:2. The concept of being saved by grace and subsequently living by grace became clarified in writing by Paul himself on the heels of the Jerusalem Council as he wrote the Book of Galatians&mdash;probably the first epistle written by Paul. It is in that letter that Paul clearly spells out the concept of salvation by grace through faith and the subsequent life of grace living that follows through the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that I favor a date for this letter somewhere in the mid 40s.</p>
		<p><a name="Trial"></a><font size="4"><b>God's people will endure testing/trial (James 1:1-15)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 &para; James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, &para; To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: &para; Greetings. <br>
		    2 &para; My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, <br>
		    3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. <br>
		    4 But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. <br>
		    5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. <br>
		    6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. <br>
		    7 For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; <br>
		    8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. <br>
		    9 &para; Let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation, <br>
		    10 but the rich in his humiliation, because as a flower of the field he will pass away. <br>
		    11 For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits. <br>
		    12 &para; Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. <br>
		    13 Let no one say when he is tempted, &ldquo;I am tempted by God&rdquo;; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. <br>
		    14 But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. <br>
	      15 Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>The recipients of this letter are declared to be quite widespread in the very first verse when he mentions &quot;the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.&quot; The phrase &quot;scattered abroad&quot; comes from a single Greek word, &quot;diaspora,&quot; which speaks of the dispersion of Jews throughout the Roman Empire. The definite article is used, which would indicate that James is speaking of a particular dispersion of Jewish Christians, perhaps the one suggested as Saul (Paul) was on his tirade against Believers in <a title="Acts 8 Summary" href="7-12.html#Saul" target="_blank">Acts 8 (see notes)</a>, following Stephen's execution. Since they are scattered, the &quot;twelve tribes&quot; is certainly James' way of indicating that his letter is for all <strong>Jewish Christians</strong> rather than being formally addressed to the individual tribes themselves.</p>

    <p>James refers to his letter recipients as &quot;brethren&quot; in verse 2. In what sense does he consider them &quot;brethren,&quot; by blood relationship or faith? Since James immediately gets to his point in the same sentence that trial/temptation is upon them because of their faith, he is undoubtedly referring to them as &quot;brethren&quot; based upon their faith in Christ. Why question that? Some have suggested a doubt regarding their status as Christian &quot;brethren&quot; based upon the conduct dealt with by James at the beginning of chapter 4 (<a href="#People">see below</a>). However, since these Jewish Christians were scattered, there simply is no feasibility to the notion that James is singling out any particular incident, but rather is addressing general issues of interpersonal conflict among Jewish Christians which he may have heard about from various sources.</p>
	<p>James discusses the issue of trials/temptations among Believers. By the way, several Greek words are used in the New Testament for this adversity and are variously translated. Read the information box entitled, &quot;Trial, Testing and Temptation&quot; located to the right of this window, <a title="Trial, Testing and Temptation" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Trial.html" target="_blank">or click here</a>. It will provide a complete overview and tie scriptures together from several New Testament passages on the subject. Two significant Greek words occur in verses 2-4, &quot;peirasmos&quot; translated &quot;temptations&quot; (KJV) and &quot;trials&quot; (NKJV) in verse 2 and &quot;dokimion&quot; translated &quot;trying&quot; (KJV) and &quot;testing&quot; (NKJV) in verse 3 - both Greek nouns. A third Greek word, a noun, is used in this first chapter in verse 12 - &quot;dokimos&quot; translated &quot;tried&quot; (KJV) and &quot;approved&quot; (NKJV). For a proper understanding of the concept of adversity, it is expedient to understand the differentiations and similarities of the words used. Here's the bottom line on verses 2-4: Without adversity, Christians don't spiritually develop. Oooo...tough concept. Look at verse 4, &quot;<font size="3"></font>But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.&quot; The Greek word for &quot;patience&quot; there is &quot;hupomone&quot; which is a compound word &quot;hupo&quot; (under) and &quot;mone&quot; (remaining) - &quot;remaining under [control].&quot; It is also translated &quot;endure&quot; in the New Testament. So, the concept is summed up in verse 4 as follows: When we endure adversity, we are perfected (matured) as Believers through that process.</p>
	<p>It's a fact; <b>trial is necessary for Christian growth.</b> That doesn't mean we flail in the darkness when we undergo trial. Verse 5 provides a guarantee regarding trial: &quot;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.&quot; That means that under trial we can know what God is working in our lives through that trial by simply seeking God's wisdom in prayer. <a title="Romans 5 Summary" href="8-17.html#Faith" target="_blank">Romans 5:2-4 (see notes)</a> gives the sequence for maturity in one's Christian life, and it's primary component is trial. Learn your lesson (from trial) and claim verse 12, &quot;Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.&quot; <b>Trial draws us closer to God and makes us a reflection of him. </b><b>Every Believer should have a clear understanding of how to deal with adversity.</b></p>
	<p><b>Incidentally, I'm convinced that the guarantee of &quot;wisdom&quot; from verse 5 is not limited to the area of trial. &quot;Wisdom&quot; from God is the key to answered prayer about anything a Believer faces. The first step in prayer should always be to seek the &quot;wisdom&quot; of God about any matter.</b> James continues with a lesson on praying with faith in verses 6-8. When one seeks wisdom from God as the first step of prayer, then he is able to &quot;ask in faith&quot; (verse 6). Notice particularly John's formula for answered prayer in <a title="I John 5 Summary" href="12-3.html#Relationship" target="_blank">I John 5:14-15 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of him.&quot; There it is...clearly written...when we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us. How's that done? Well...there's your answer in James 1:5 - asking God for wisdom. The disappointments of unanswered prayers are explained in verses 6-8; they were not prayers of faith because they were not founded on wisdom. A successful prayer life must be based upon the &quot;wisdom&quot; of verse 5. Unfortunately, most Christians are &quot;double minded&quot; (Greek: &quot;dipsuchos&quot;), indecisive, when they pray. Why? They did not seek wisdom as the first step to their prayers.</p>
	<p><a name="9"></a>Verses 9-11 may seem out of place here. Keep in mind, these verses are located in the midst of verses about adversity. Relief from adversity was directly addressed in verses 2-4, followed by an admonition to pray for wisdom regarding that adversity in 5-8. The theme of adversity directly continues in verse 12, so verses 9-11 must be related to this whole theme of adversity. Perhaps the thought here is that &quot;the lowly brother&quot; (Greek: &quot;tapeinos&quot; means &quot;humble&quot;) seems to be experiencing more adversity than his not-so-hard-up brother. While &quot;tapeinos&quot; doesn't necessarily speak to material wealth, the comparison with the &quot;rich&quot; of verse 10 definitely indicates a comparison between those who have it and those who don't. Additionally, James picks this back up as a theme in chapter 2 (<a href="#Refrain">see below</a>). It is important to note, however, that James is not simply talking about wealth here, but obviously the use of that wealth. He gives an illustration from nature in verses 10-11 to indicate that wealth itself is temporary with this final phrase, &quot;So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.&quot; From that, we deduct that he's describing those who are stingy with their wealth while their Christian brethren are suffering. As seen above, the reward for those experiencing adversity is seen in verse 12 as eternal, compared to the temporal advantages of wealth.</p>
	<p><b>Verses 13-15 merit some special attention here.</b> If you read the overview of temptation provided in the box to the right of this window, you saw that Satan is the one who brings trial aka testing aka temptation into the Believer's life. That Believer was capable of passing that test of adversity (<a title="I Corinthians 10 Summary" href="11-17.html#Chastisement" target="_blank">Hebrews 12:6-8, see notes</a>). That process is called chastisement. In this case, adversity in the Believer's life as a result of sin is orchestrated by God himself.</p>
	<p>Admittedly, this may seem a little confusing at this point. You ask, &quot;So what's the difference between trial (testing, temptation) and chastisement? Perhaps the clearest Biblical example of trial is that of Job in the Old Testament. In <a title="Job 1 Summary" href="1-6.html#Fear" target="_blank">Job 1:11-12 (see notes)</a> we see that God permitted Satan to put Job to the test. It was a horrific test. Everything that happened to Job was brought on him by Satan. What was Satan's goal? It was to bring Job to a point in his life where &quot;he will curse you [God] to your face.&quot;    </p>

    <p><a name="Chastisement"></a>Here's the differentiation between trial (temptation) and chastisement. Were Job to have succumbed to that temptation, that would have been sin. But he did not succumb. However, sometimes Believers do fall into Satan's trap and do that which they know is sin. That's when chastisement (from God) is in order. Read carefully the information box provided to the right of this window entitled, &quot;Trial versus Chastisement&quot; or <a title="Trial versus Chastisement" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Trial_vs_chastisement.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Words"></a>Words hurt! (James 1:16-27)</b></font><br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">16 &para; Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. <br>
		    17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning. <br>
		    18 Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures. <br>
		    19 &para; So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; <br>
		    20 for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God. <br>
		    21 &para; Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. <br>
		    22 &para; But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. <br>
		    23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; <br>
		    24 for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. <br>
		    25 But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does. <br>
		    26 &para; If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one&rsquo;s religion is useless. <br>
	      27 Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>In relation to material wealth, verse 17 says, &quot;Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above...&quot; What is the gift being referenced here? It's the salvation of verse 18, &quot;Of His own will <strong>He brought us forth by the word of truth</strong>, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.&quot; With that in mind, obedient Christians are careful with their testimony before the world. This may be a good time to recall <a title="Galatians 5 Summary" href="9-30.html#Key" target="_blank">Galatians 5:22-23 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.&quot; Words and actions are in view here in these verses. When Believers are led by the Holy Spirit, these are the attributes that are displayed - not a sharp tongue. James addresses the issue of Believers being &quot;doers&quot; of the word. Is it a coincidence that James talks about temptation followed by chastisement followed by the quality of the Christian's conduct before the world? No coincidence here. When a Believer is serious about serving God, he will naturally protect his public testimony. In other words, Christ in one's life ought to be seen by others as a visible desire to please God. When Believers are committed to our &quot;religion&quot; (Greek: &quot;threskeia&quot; means &quot;devout practices) good things flow out from our lives. Both our words (verse 26) and actions (verse 27) are glorifying to God.</p>
	<p>You will notice in these verses that James seems to attribute a negative testimony to uncontrolled anger when he says in verse 20, &quot;for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.&quot; This is followed by his admonition that Believers should exercise the principles of their faith rather than simply be observers. He compares this to the man who looks in a mirror, but makes no changes with regard to his appearance. However, looking into the Word of God ought to result in a desire for positive change - a change that will come through the working of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><a name="Refrain"></a><font size="4"><b>Refrain from partiality (James 2:1-13)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality. <br>
		    2 For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in filthy clothes, <br>
		    3 and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, &ldquo;You sit here in a good place,&rdquo; and say to the poor man, &ldquo;You stand there,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Sit here at my footstool,&rdquo; <br>
		    4 have you not shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? <br>
		    5 &para; Listen, my beloved brethren: Has God not chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him? <br>
		    6 But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts? <br>
		    7 Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are called? <br>
		    8 &para; If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo; you do well; <br>
		    9 but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors. <br>
		    10 For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all. <br>
		    11 For He who said, &ldquo;Do not commit adultery,&rdquo; also said, &ldquo;Do not murder.&rdquo; Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. <br>
		    12 So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty. <br>
	      13 For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>James resumes a theme he touched on in 1:9-11 (<a href="#9">see above</a>), the relationship between those who are wealthy within the local assembly and those who are not. Incidentally, James refers to the &quot;assembly&quot; with the Greek word that is usually translated &quot;synagogue.&quot; Being a very early epistle, the assembly of Believers probably retained this designation until the term &quot;church&quot;  (Greek: &quot;ekklesia&quot; means &quot;called-out assembly&quot;) began to be used. He is obviously talking about an assembly of Jewish Believers here.</p>
	<p>It's bad to esteem one Believer over another. To favor the wealthy-looking man over the poorly-dressed man is to superficially judge based upon &quot;evil thoughts&quot; (verse 4). Wealth has nothing to do with one's standing with Christ (verse 5), so he encourages his readers not to show the same disdain for the poor that the rich of the world do (verse 6). After all, it is they who persecute all Believers (verse 7). Then James refers to the last six commandments as the treat-others-like-royalty commandments (verse 8). These last six deal with the person-to-person relationship while the first four deal with the person-to-God relationship. Christ sets the precedent for dividing the 10 commandments up into these two categories in <a title="Matthew 22 Summary" href="5-9.html#Commandment" target="_blank">Matthew 22:36-40 (see notes)</a> when he points out that the &quot;greatest&quot; commandment is &quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.&quot; He goes on to identify the second by saying, &quot;And the second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'&quot; These two commandments identify the intent of the Old Testament Law. So...what about the Believer who demonstrates a love for God, but does not demonstrate a love for people. James points out that to keep all the commandments except one is to still be a violator of the law. Spirit-led Believers will treat others like royalty.</p>
	<p>This very early epistle written to Jewish Believers draws upon their continued adherence to the Law of Moses in these verses. James emphasizes that respect for one's fellow Believer, rich or poor, is just as important as exercising restraint in adultery or murder. He then refers to the contrast between law and grace when he declares in verse 12, &quot;So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.&quot; Jesus had emphasized this concept in <a href="5-25.html#Betrayer" title="John 13 Summary" target="_blank">John 13-34-35 (see notes)</a> when he said, &quot;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&quot; He serves a warning to those who ignore this exhortation in verse 13, &quot;For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.&quot; When you serve out &quot;judgment without mercy,&quot; don't be surprised when you are the recipient of &quot;judgment without mercy.&quot; Thank the Lord that God is merciful!</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>People are looking for evidence of salvation - works (James 2:14-26)</b></font><br>

		  <p><font size="2">14 &para; What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? <br>
		    15 If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, <br>

		    18 &para; But someone will say, &ldquo;You have faith, and I have works.&rdquo; Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. <br>
		    19 You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe&mdash;and tremble! <br>
		    20 But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? <br>
		    21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? <br>
		    22 Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? <br>
		    23 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&rdquo; And he was called the friend of God. <br>
		    24 You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. <br>
		    25 &para; Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way? <br>
	      26 &para; For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. </font></p>

	<p>I often hear people say, &quot;I don't care what people think about me!&quot; I generally conclude that they are lying when they tell me that. Everybody cares to some degree - even those who want to be known for saying they don't. <b>These verses actually continue the theme of verses 1-13.</b> Since the fruit of the Spirit (<a title="Galatians 5 Summary" href="9-30.html#Key" target="_blank">Galatians 5:22-23, see notes</a>) will demonstrate attributes in a Believer that eliminate the danger of a violation of verses 1-13, the violator of verses 1-13 must question his motivation. James is pointing out that the natural tendency of salvation is to do good works. That's what the world sees in us. How do we demonstrate our salvation with others? Answer: good works! So, is it fair for the world to be inspecting our lives for indications of salvation in Jesus Christ? Maybe not, but life's not fair.</p>
	<p><b>These 13 verses are quite troubling to many.</b> Some even use these verses to promote a works-based salvation. Others are troubled by what perhaps appears to them to be a contradiction of Paul in <a title="Romans 4 Summary" href="8-13.html#Faith" target="_blank">Romans 4 (see notes)</a>. As a matter of fact, James and Paul even use a common example - Abraham.</p>
		<p><b>Let's take a look at Paul's words found in <a title="Romans 4 Summary" href="8-13.html#Faith" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a><b>:</b></p>
<blockquote>
			<p>1 What then shall we say that Abraham our father has found according to the flesh? <br>
			  2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. <br>
			  3 For what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&rdquo;<br>
			  4 Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt. <br>
		    5 But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness, </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>Admittedly, that may seem confusing in light of James' statement in verses 20-24:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>20 But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? <br>
			  21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? <br>

			  23 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&rdquo; And he was called the friend of God. <br>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Of the two epistles, Romans was likely written much later than James. The audience was quite different as well. James was written to Jewish Believers (James 1:1, &quot;twelve tribes&quot;), while Jews in Rome were sparse. James was dealing with the big problem in the early church which was especially visible in Jerusalem - the equal treatment of Believers in the church (<a title="Acts 6 Summary" href="8-1.html#Paul" target="_blank">Acts 21 (see notes)</a></font>. As you will recall from the Book of Acts, there was a very slow transition for those who had been raised as Jews to a life of grace in Christ from a life dictated by the Law of Moses. James discusses the godly treatment of others in chapter 2. He makes the point that faith in Christ ought to be represented by a love for all Believers. His emphasis is that real faith ought to be demonstrable. When it isn't, well...it ought to be. James is talking about how others view our &quot;religion&quot; (James 1:26-27). <strong>He's emphasizing our visible testimony of works to demonstrate our faith to others, not as the conditions for saving faith.</strong> <strong>Paul, on the other hand, is strictly talking about the simplicity of salvation without works.</strong> Paul emphasizes the actual condition for obtaining salvation, faith alone, while James is talking about public testimony. Context for both passages is important here.</p>
	<p>Speaking of context, let's get specific here. James seems to be addressing those who are among the wealthier in the assembly when he talks about &quot;works&quot; here. Look at his example in verses 15-16; it deals with a &quot;brother or sister&quot; aka Believer who is destitute. The actions of works referenced here are those of sharing one's wealth in such situations. Taken in context, it further shows James' intent and makes us realize what &quot;works&quot; he's talking about here - works of generosity. That's what is being addressed in verse 17 when he says, &quot;Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.&quot; These are works of generosity. The &quot;demons&quot; believe that there is one God (verse 19), but their actions aren't positively affected. Therefore, believing the one-God concept does not constitute salvation. The further examples of Abraham and Rahab are intended to show that faith fosters a proactive direction in one's life.</p>
	<p>To sum it up, salvation is by grace alone - plus nothing, minus nothing. One isn't saved or kept saved by a &quot;works&quot; supplement to salvation. After salvation, however, &quot;Pure and undefiled religion before God&quot; (James 1:27, <a href="#Words">see above</a>) will demonstrate one's salvation to others by the way one lives his life.</p>

		    2 For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body. <br>
		    3 Indeed, we put bits in horses&rsquo; mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body. <br>
		    4 Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires. <br>

    </blockquote>
	<p>We're still continuing our theme of lifestyle from chapter 2. James begins by saying, &quot;My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment.&quot; Let's look at a couple of Greek words in this verse. &quot;Teachers&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;didaskalos&quot; which is translated &quot;masters&quot; in the KJV. Here, the KJV uses it in the context of a master teacher. The Greek word for &quot;judgment&quot; here is &quot;krima&quot; which means &quot;judgment,&quot; but not necessarily condemnatory judgment. The KJV translates it as &quot;condemnation.&quot; James is declaring that teachers of the Word of God have a greater responsibility before God for their words and actions. That sets the tone for the comments to follow. In verse 2 he explains that, when you can control your words, your actions will follow. One who controls his words and actions is a &quot;perfect&quot; (Greek: teleios - mature, complete) man.</p>
	<p>The lesson of these verses is, &quot;Watch your mouth!&quot; Several analogies are used to illustrate - animals, fires, ships. Just as a large horse is able to be controlled by a small bridle, so is the tongue. Just as a large ship is able to be controlled by a small rudder, so is the tongue. Just as a large (forest - Greek: hule) fire can be started by a small spark (verse 5), so can controversy out of words from the tongue. All of these are to drive the point home that a loose tongue can do a great deal of damage. </p>
	<p>James then addresses the unregenerate nature of the tongue...actually of the loose tongue of the carnal man when he says in verse 8, &quot;But no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.&quot; Because of our carnal nature, sometimes the same tongue can speak honorably...and sometimes dishonorably (verses 9-10). Being controlled by the Spirit is in view here when he makes the point in verses  11-12 that your tongue indicates what's in your heart. In other words, if you have a sharp, mean tongue, it's probably because you're a sharp, mean person. I don't make the news, I just report it. Again, we should take note of the results of being controlled by the Holy Spirit as seen in <a title="Galatians 5 Summary" href="9-30.html#Key" target="_blank">Galatians 5:22-23 (see notes)</a>. When we are controlled by the Holy Spirit, our tongue is controlled.</p>
  <p><font size="4"><b>And where does this meanness come from? (James 3:13-18)</b></font><br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">13 &para; Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom. <br>
		    14 But if you have bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth. <br>
		    15 This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic. <br>
		    16 For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there. <br>
		    17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. <br>
	      18 Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>As these verses point out, meanness doesn't come from God! Godly wise men display a positive Christian testimony (verse 13). We see in verses 14-16 that &quot;bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts&quot; are not products from God, but are instead, &quot;earthly, sensual, demonic.&quot; As a matter of fact, verses 17-18 sound a lot like <a title="Galatians 5 Summary" href="9-30.html#Key" target="_blank">Galatians 5:22-23 (see notes)</a> where we find the &quot;fruit of the Spirit.&quot; When Believers are not led by the Holy Spirit, the old Adamic nature begins to dominate. Victorious Christian living is only possible through control of the Holy Spirit in one's life. Let's be clear: <b>Contentious behavior toward Believers does not originate from God.</b></p>
	<p>Incidentally, it is the Adamic nature in each of us that gives us the propensity to sin...from the day of our birth. We have this sin nature because of Adam's fall in <a href="1-2.html#Satan" title="Genesis 3 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 3 (see notes)</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Notice the passages where Paul makes reference to Adam and the sin nature:</b></p>
		<ul>
          <li><a title="Romans 5 Summary" href="8-17.html#Contrast" target="_blank">Romans 5:14 (see notes)</a> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.
          <li><a title="I Corinthians 15 Summary" href="9-10.html#Corinthians" target="_blank">I Corinthians 15:22 (see notes)</a> For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.
          <li><a title="I Corinthians 15 Summary" href="9-10.html#Body" target="_blank">I Corinthians 15:45 (see notes)</a> And so it is written, &ldquo;The first man Adam became a living being.&rdquo; The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
          <li><a title="I Timothy 2 Summary" href="10-28.html#Testimony" target="_blank">I Timothy 2:13-14 (see notes)</a>  For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression.
    </ul>
<p>While James does not specifically refer to this tendency as the Adamic nature in verses 14-16, the concept is there. It is only through the leadership of the Holy Spirit in a Believer's life that he is able to overcome the tendencies of the Adamic nature.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>James takes off here on worldly-acting Believers. It's really a continuation of the end of chapter 3 regarding strife compared to Godly wisdom. In addition to &quot;fights&quot; (Greek: &quot;mache&quot; means &quot;strifes&quot; or &quot;conflicts&quot;), James uses a very strong word here to describe these conflicts. The Greek word for &quot;war&quot; is &quot;polemos&quot; which is the military term for war. Keep in mind, his readers are scattered, so there may not be a particular situation about which he is speaking here. However, James is obviously driving home the seriousness of the strife in chapter 3.</p>
<p>There's no question; James is referring to Believers who are acting like lost people in verses 2-4. For those who would maintain that verses 2-4 describe the unregenerate instead, take a look at verses 5-10. James acknowledges the tendencies of the carnal nature when he says in verse 5, &quot;do you think that the Scripture says in vain, 'The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously'?&quot; James seems to be pulling together some Old Testament concepts into one concise thought regarding man's propensity to sin. However, he declares that this propensity is overcome by &quot;grace&quot; (verse 6), submitting to God and resisting the devil (verse 7) and by drawing close to God (verse 8). These are the steps an out-of-fellowship-with-God Believer should take to get back on the correct footing with God. </p>
	<p><b>James actually itemizes some steps to restoration with God in verses 8-10:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>&quot;Cleanse your hands, you sinners&quot;
			  <br>
			&quot;Cleanse&quot; is from the Greek verb &quot;katharizo.&quot; It is used in the New Testament in reference to literal or cermonial cleansing.
			<li>&quot;purify your hearts, you double-minded.&quot;<br>
			  Only James uses the Greek word &quot;dipsuchos&quot; for &quot;double-minded&quot; - here and James 1:8 (<a href="#Trial">see above</a>).
		  It is used to indicate being uncertain about the truth of something.
		  <li>&quot;Lament and mourn and weep!&quot; 
			<li>&quot;Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.&quot;
			<li>&quot;Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.&quot;
		</ul>
	<p><b>These steps are intended to make these misdirected Believers cease their reprehensible conduct, display remorse for such and turn to God.</b></p>
		<p>Now, don't lose sight of the theme here. We're reminded of it again in verse 11, &quot;Do not speak evil of one another...&quot; That's right...it's still their interaction between one another. They have the Law of Moses, which they must have thought they were honoring, when they exercise such contentious behavior (verse 11-12). Finally, in verses 13-17 James points out how temporary life really is. If you want to prepare, prepare for eternity and stop placing so much value on temporary things.</p>
	<p><b>We see in verse 17 the definition of &quot;sin&quot; for the Believer.</b> Let's take care to understand the distinction here; this verse references the actions taken by Believers when it says, &quot;Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.&quot; This knowledge of knowing &quot;good&quot; comes from the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit offering leadership. When a Believer violates this Holy Spirit leadership towards good, that constitutes sin. Keep in mind...we're not talking about just blatant overt sin here, but James is including conduct that may look fine on the outside, but is really not surrendered to the Holy Spirit's leadership. We see details regarding this leadership of the Holy Spirit in <a href="8-17.html#Lives" title="Romans 8 Summary" target="_blank">Romans 8:1-11 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>A warning to the unethical rich (James 5:1-6)</b></font><br>

		    2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. <br>
		    3 Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days. <br>
		    4 Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. <br>
		    5 You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter. <br>
	      6 You have condemned, you have murdered the just; he does not resist you. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>James takes one more swipe at those rich who dwelt among their poor brethren and did not share. These are strong words - so strong, in fact, that it almost seems that he must be describing lost people here. Actually, they're the same people reproved in each of the preceding four chapters. Their less fortunate brethren were suffering while they were living in luxury and refusing to share. These verses are addressing those who came by their riches at the expense of others through unethical and dishonest means. They stood by, and perhaps even participated in the unjust treatment of their less fortunate brethren who were scattered also. From the wording of verse 6, not only did they not assist their needy brethren, they participated in the conviction and execution of those who were needy. Murder is not necessarily the meaning here, but unjust treatment in the courts resulting in execution may be what is meant.</p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Be patient and get along (James 5:7-12)</b></font><br>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">7 &para; Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain. <br>
	    8 You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. <br>
	    9 &para; Do not grumble against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the Judge is standing at the door! <br>
	    10 My brethren, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of suffering and patience. <br>
	    11 Indeed we count them blessed who endure. You have heard of the perseverance of Job and seen the end intended by the Lord&mdash;that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful. <br>
      12 &para; But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. But let your &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; be &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and your &ldquo;No,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; lest you fall into judgment. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Now we turn back to those who are suffering. Patience and mutually-honoring treatment is encouraged between them. The Lord is coming back, but until then, be diligent in your work and get along with others. Ill treatment of your brethren reaps one's own condemnation (Greek: katakrino - always negative judgment). The suffering-under-adverse-condition prophets are cited as examples. Jeremiah was placed in prison and lowered into a cistern...just for telling the truth of God. In addition, an example of Job's patience is given as far as being patient under adversity. No question - Job is the poster child for adversity (<a href="2-2.html#Pharisees" target="_blank">Matthew 5:33-37 (see notes)</a>.</p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Prayer for the sick (James 5:13-18)</b></font><br>

	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">13 &para; Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. <br>
	    14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. <br>
	    15 And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. <br>
	    16 Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. <br>
	    17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. <br>
      18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>James deals with praying for the sick by the Elders of the church. Some have suggested that the anointing of oil in verse 14 is really just the applying of medicine to an injury or taking medicine. They attempt to do a play on Greek words to make their point. That's a very weak argument of scripture.. The Greek word &quot;aleipho&quot; is used here as it is every time in the New Testament when oil is used ceremonially to anoint. James is teaching a procedure of anointing the individual who has health issues with oil after they have come to the Elders to ask for this procedure. Since the directions seem to be exact here, it seems inappropriate for an Elder or Elders to do the calling (i.e. a healing line at a religious meeting). The process starts with the ill person calling for the Elders and not vice versa. A confession of sins seems to be an important component to healing here also.</p>
	<p>Some have attempted to dismiss these verses as belonging to another dispensation. I see no evidence to that being the case in the scriptures. Therefore, when folks ask that Elders gather together, anoint with oil and pray for their sickness, it appears to be a New Testament mandate for us to do exactly that.</p>
	<p>James uses Elijah as an example of faith in verses 17-18. He's referring to the drought and subsequent rain in which Elijah was instrumental in God's judgment against that wicked King Ahab. That account is found in <a href="8-26.html#Elijah" title="I Kings 17-18 summary" target="_blank">I Kings 17-18 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>What about those who turn their backs on God (James 5:19-20)</b></font><br>

	      20 let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Don't make the mistake of seeing this as spiritual death. When a person assists another Believer in seeing his deviation from sound Christian practice, he helps to deliver him from certain chastisement and possibly death. The Greek word for &quot;turns him back&quot; is &quot;epistrepho&quot; which means &quot;to turn again.&quot; Christians who rebel against God need to be turned back to their serving-God status. Read the information box above entitled, &quot;<a href="#Chastisement">Trial versus Chastisement</a>&quot; for a clear perspective on this concept. These two verses have nothing to do whatsoever with salvation in Christ - just physical chastisement.</p>
