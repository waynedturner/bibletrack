<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, <br>
    2 &ldquo;Son of man, write down the name of the day, this very day&mdash;the king of Babylon started his siege against Jerusalem this very day. <br>
    3 And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD:<br>
&lsquo;Put on a pot, set it on,<br>
And also pour water into it. <br>
4 	Gather pieces of meat in it,<br>
Every good piece,<br>
The thigh and the shoulder.<br>
Fill it with choice cuts; <br>
5 	Take the choice of the flock.<br>
Also pile fuel bones under it,<br>
Make it boil well,<br>
And let the cuts simmer in it.&rdquo; <br>
6 &para; &ldquo;Therefore thus says the Lord GOD:<br>
&lsquo;Woe to the bloody city,<br>
To the pot whose scum is in it,<br>
And whose scum is not gone from it!<br>
Bring it out piece by piece,<br>
On which no lot has fallen. <br>
7 	For her blood is in her midst;<br>
She set it on top of a rock;<br>
She did not pour it on the ground,<br>
To cover it with dust. <br>
8 	That it may raise up fury and take vengeance,<br>
I have set her blood on top of a rock,<br>
That it may not be covered.&rdquo; <br>
9 &para; &ldquo;Therefore thus says the Lord GOD:<br>
&lsquo;Woe to the bloody city!<br>
I too will make the pyre great. <br>
10 	Heap on the wood,<br>
Kindle the fire;<br>
Cook the meat well,<br>
Mix in the spices,<br>
And let the cuts be burned up. <br>
11 	&ldquo;Then set the pot empty on the coals,<br>
That it may become hot and its bronze may burn,<br>
That its filthiness may be melted in it,<br>
That its scum may be consumed. <br>
12 	She has grown weary with lies,<br>
And her great scum has not gone from her.<br>
Let her scum be in the fire! <br>
13 	In your filthiness is lewdness.<br>
Because I have cleansed you, and you were not cleansed,<br>
You will not be cleansed of your filthiness anymore,<br>
Till I have caused My fury to rest upon you. <br>
14 	I, the LORD, have spoken it;<br>
It shall come to pass, and I will do it;<br>
I will not hold back,<br>
Nor will I spare,<br>
Nor will I relent;<br>
According to your ways<br>
And according to your deeds<br>
They will judge you,&rdquo;<br>
Says the Lord GOD.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;  <br>

<p>We have a date and a new set of prophecies. The date is December/January 589/588 B.C. according to verse 1. The rendering there is based upon the length of captivity of Jehoiachin who was taken to prison in Babylon. <b>This is the day that the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar began over 600 miles away (as the crow flies, 850 miles over land) in Jerusalem.</b> Remember, Ezekiel lived in Babylon with the exiles already. The exiles to whom Ezekiel was prophesying would have had no way of knowing the siege had begun so far away for quite some time, but Ezekiel had supernatural knowledge from God. It would take a couple of years for Jerusalem to actually fall; this happened in 586 B.C.</p>
<p>On this day, <b>Ezekiel is told to cook.</b> Ezekiel did a lot of object lessons. Here's the way it boils down (pun intended). <b>The pot is Jerusalem, the choice cuts of meat are the inhabitants. The fire is the Babylonian army.</b> In verse 6 we see the pot has &quot;scum&quot; in it (a reference to rust or some other residue making it inappropriate for cooking). <b>The &quot;scum&quot; represents the corruption of the people in Jerusalem.</b> Since the meal (cooked in a scummy pot) is yucky, Ezekiel empties the contents out into the fire (Jerusalem is breached). So,<b> the iron pot represented the safety of the city of Jerusalem.</b> Remember that the Assyrians (over 100 years earlier) could not breach the city - though they tried for months. <b>This time, however, the contents of the pot (people in Jerusalem) will be exposed to the judgment fire (the enemy army).</b></p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>Then a very sad object lesson (Ezekiel 24:15-27)</b></font><br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">15 &para; Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, <br>
		    16 &ldquo;Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears run down. <br>
		    17 Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban on your head, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your lips, and do not eat man&rsquo;s bread of sorrow.&rdquo; <br>
		    18 &para; So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died; and the next morning I did as I was commanded. <br>
		    19 &para; And the people said to me, &ldquo;Will you not tell us what these things signify to us, that you behave so?&rdquo; <br>
		    20 &para; Then I answered them, &ldquo;The word of the LORD came to me, saying, <br>
		    21 &ldquo;Speak to the house of Israel, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;Behold, I will profane My sanctuary, your arrogant boast, the desire of your eyes, the delight of your soul; and your sons and daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword. <br>
		    22 And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your lips nor eat man&rsquo;s bread of sorrow.<br>
		    23 Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you shall neither mourn nor weep, but you shall pine away in your iniquities and mourn with one another. <br>
		    24 Thus Ezekiel is a sign to you; according to all that he has done you shall do; and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
		    25 &para; &ldquo;And you, son of man&mdash;will it not be in the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that on which they set their minds, their sons and their daughters: <br>
		    26 on that day one who escapes will come to you to let you hear it with your ears; <br>
	      27 on that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped; you shall speak and no longer be mute. Thus you will be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am the LORD.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>These are very sad verses. First of all, realize what a lonely life Ezekiel must have had; virtually nobody seemed to like him...except for Mrs. Ezekiel. He'd go out in the mornings to warn the people of the exile about their corruption and that of the people in Jerusalem, but they didn't listen to him. They hated Ezekiel - hated the truth. It must have been a great comfort to come home each day to a wife who cared for him. But one day he gets this word from God: &quot;As a sign, I'm taking your wife from you.&quot; Talk about &quot;Why Lord!!!!!?&quot; Ezekiel is commanded by God to handle this great, great loss without the customary acts of mourning as an example to the exiles for when they realize that their sacred temple in Jerusalem along with their relatives have been lost in the siege on Jerusalem. So, the sad verse is 18, &quot;So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died; and the next morning I did as I was commanded.&quot; Now...that's commitment!<img src="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/image/Map_Israel_surrounding.jpg" alt="Map of the nations against whom judgment was pronounced in Ezekiel 25" height="300" width="242" align="right" border="0"></p>

    14 I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel, that they may do in Edom according to My anger and according to My fury; and they shall know My vengeance,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD. <br>
    15 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;Because the Philistines dealt vengefully and took vengeance with a spiteful heart, to destroy because of the old hatred,&rdquo; <br>
    16 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: &ldquo;I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast. <br>

<p><b>Ezekiel prophesies the fall of all Jerusalem's neighbors:</b></p>
<ul>
			<li><b>Ammon in verses 1-7
<br>
				</b>The Ammonites were the neighbors of Israel that lived on the east side of the Jordan next door to the tribe of Gad. Nebuchadnezzar conquered Ammon in the fifth year after the destruction of Jerusalem. Jeremiah prophesied their fall also in <a title="Jeremiah 49 Summary" href="11-10.html#Ammonites" target="_blank">Jeremiah 49:1-6 (see notes)</a>.						<li><b>Moab and Seir in verses 8-11
<br>
				</b>This was the land east of the Jordan above Edom and below Ammon. Nebuchadnezzar conquered that whole region. Jeremiah prophesied their fall also in <a title="Jeremiah 48 Summary" href="11-8.html#Moab" target="_blank">Jeremiah 48 (see notes)</a>.						<li><b>Edom in verses 12-14
<br>
				</b>These are Esau's descendants. They lived southeast of Israel with a long history of hatred toward Israel. Edom had a long, colorful history with Israel going all the way back to Jacob and Esau. Edom was Esau's nickname. Jeremiah prophesied their fall also in <a title="Jeremiah 49 Summary" href="12-30.html#Tough" target="_blank">Malachi 1:2-5 (see notes)</a> - all prophecies against Edom.
  <li><b>Philistia in verses 15-17
<br>
				</b>This territory was down on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea where modern-day Gaza is located. It was always a troublesome territory to Israel; the Philistines gave Israel fits. Isaiah also briefly prophesies their fall in <a title="Isaiah 14 Summary" href="9-20.html#Philistia" target="_blank">Isaiah 14:28-32 (see notes)</a>.		</ul>

	<p>We see from verse 1 that this prophecy (chapters 26-28) was pronounced against Tyre while the siege of Jerusalem was in process in the &quot;eleventh&quot; year (586 B.C.). This date is based upon the captivity of Judah's King Jehoiachin in Babylon. Tyre was a city just north of Israel on the coast - a big port city in today's Lebanon. It was an independent, booming trade city. The next 3 chapters are going to be the prophecy concerning the total devastation of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar's army. It would appear from verse 2 that the inhabitants of Tyre were getting a good bit of satisfaction out of the impending fall of Jerusalem. The same fate shall befall them. So, Tyre, in response to your &quot;Aha!&quot; in verse 2, this is for you, &quot;na na na na na!&quot;</p>
	<p>Incidentally Isaiah prophesied their fall also in <a title="Isaiah 23 Summary" href="9-13.html#Judgment" target="_blank">Amos 1:9-10 (see notes)</a>.</p>

They will take up a lamentation,<br>
And lament for you:<br>
&ldquo;What city is like Tyre,<br>
Destroyed in the midst of the sea? <br>
33 	&ldquo;When your wares went out by sea,<br>
You satisfied many people;<br>
You enriched the kings of the earth<br>
With your many luxury goods and your merchandise. <br>
34 	But you are broken by the seas in the depths of the waters;<br>
Your merchandise and the entire company will fall in your midst. <br>
35 	All the inhabitants of the isles will be astonished at you;<br>
Their kings will be greatly afraid,<br>
And their countenance will be troubled. <br>
36 	The merchants among the peoples will hiss at you;<br>
You will become a horror, and be no more forever.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </font></p>

	<p>We started reading about Tyre in chapter 26 (<a href="#Tyre">see above</a>). This city is located just above Israel - between Israel and Lebanon. Tyre was its own city/state - sort of like Jerusalem after Judah fell. It was a big trade city with the best of everything. Notice the long list of their trading partners in this prophecy.</p>
		<p>Tyre had fallen to Assyria, but had regained its independence simply because Assyria had too much on its plate to keep its whole empire in check as Assyria was on the decline. Hang on Tyre; you're about to meet the Babylonians. As a matter of fact, the cities and nations with whom Tyre had been doing business will turn on them - possibly out of a fear of the Babylonians. Tyre in this chapter is presented as an overloaded ship that was sunk by the east wind of Babylonia - an interesting metaphor, don't you think?</p>
	<p>By the way, we're still not finished with Tyre; <a title="Ezekiel 28 Summary" href="11-27.html#Tyre" target="_blank">Ezekiel 28 (see notes)</a> is dedicated to these people also.</p>
