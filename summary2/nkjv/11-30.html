	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">1 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, <br>
	    2 &ldquo;Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it, <br>
	    3 and say to it, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD:<br>
&lsquo;Behold, O Mount Seir, I am against you;<br>
I will stretch out My hand against you,<br>
And make you most desolate; <br>
4 	I shall lay your cities waste,<br>
And you shall be desolate.<br>
Then you shall know that I am the LORD. <br>
5 &para; &ldquo;Because you have had an ancient hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, when their iniquity came to an end, <br>
6 therefore, as I live,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD, &ldquo;I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; since you have not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you. <br>
7 Thus I will make Mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it the one who leaves and the one who returns. <br>
8 And I will fill its mountains with the slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those who are slain by the sword shall fall. <br>
9 I will make you perpetually desolate, and your cities shall be uninhabited; then you shall know that I am the LORD. <br>
10 &para; &ldquo;Because you have said, &lsquo;These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess them,&rsquo; although the LORD was there, <br>
11 therefore, as I live,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD, &ldquo;I will do according to your anger and according to the envy which you showed in your hatred against them; and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you. <br>
12 Then you shall know that I am the LORD. I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, &ldquo;They are desolate; they are given to us to consume.&rsquo; <br>
13 Thus with your mouth you have boasted against Me and multiplied your words against Me; I have heard them.&rdquo; <br>
14 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;The whole earth will rejoice when I make you desolate. <br>
15 As you rejoiced because the inheritance of the house of Israel was desolate, so I will do to you; you shall be desolate, O Mount Seir, as well as all of Edom&mdash;all of it! Then they shall know that I am the LORD.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Here's another prophecy against Edom. Mount Seir is located in Edom. They already received mention in Ezekiel's prophecy (<a title="Ezekiel 25 Summary" href="3-27.html#Curse" target="_blank">Numbers 24:15-19, see notes</a>).</p>

	    <p>Therefore, it would seem that Ezekiel uses Edom as the epitome of nations that sought to overrun and acquire Israel&#146;s land for themselves. Ezekiel is clear on the reason for Edom's demise in verses 5-6, &quot;'Because you have had an ancient hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, when their iniquity came to an end, therefore, as I live,' says the Lord GOD, 'I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; since you have not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you.'&quot; That kinda reminds me of God's words to Abraham in <a title="Genesis 12 Summary" href="1-22.html#Top" target="_blank">Genesis 12:3 (see notes)</a>, &quot;I will bless those who bless you, 	And I will curse him who curses you.&quot;          </p>
    <p>It is clear from this passage that Edom will not prosper. Incidentally, <b>this land coincides with the nation of Jordan today.</b> There's a rather interesting prophetic theory that centers around this region during the tribulation period (<a title="Micah 2 Summary" href="12-27.html#Armageddon" title="Revelation 19 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 19:11-21 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Why Israel fell (Ezekiel 36:1-21)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, &lsquo;O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD! <br>
    2 Thus says the Lord GOD: &ldquo;Because the enemy has said of you, &lsquo;Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; <br>
    3 therefore prophesy, and say, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;Because they made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you are taken up by the lips of talkers and slandered by the people&rdquo;&mdash; <br>
    4 therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, the valleys, the desolate wastes, and the cities that have been forsaken, which became plunder and mockery to the rest of the nations all around&mdash; <br>
    5 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: &ldquo;Surely I have spoken in My burning jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave My land to themselves as a possession, with wholehearted joy and spiteful minds, in order to plunder its open country.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; <br>
    6 &para; &ldquo;Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, and the valleys, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and My fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations.&rdquo; <br>
    7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: &ldquo;I have raised My hand in an oath that surely the nations that are around you shall bear their own shame. <br>
    8 But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are about to come. <br>
    9 For indeed I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown. <br>
    10 I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. <br>
    11 I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bear young; I will make you inhabited as in former times, and do better for you than at your beginnings. Then you shall know that I am the LORD. <br>
    12 Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, My people Israel; they shall take possession of you, and you shall be their inheritance; no more shall you bereave them of children.&rdquo; <br>
    13 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &ldquo;Because they say to you, &lsquo;You devour men and bereave your nation of children,&rsquo; <br>
    14 therefore you shall devour men no more, nor bereave your nation anymore,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD. <br>
    15 Nor will I let you hear the taunts of the nations anymore, nor bear the reproach of the peoples anymore, nor shall you cause your nation to stumble anymore,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
    16 &para; Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying: <br>
    17 &ldquo;Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own ways and deeds; to Me their way was like the uncleanness of a woman in her customary impurity. <br>
    18 Therefore I poured out My fury on them for the blood they had shed on the land, and for their idols with which they had defiled it. <br>
    19 So I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout the countries; I judged them according to their ways and their deeds. <br>
    20 When they came to the nations, wherever they went, they profaned My holy name&mdash;when they said of them, &ldquo;These are the people of the LORD, and yet they have gone out of His land.&rsquo; <br>
    21 But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations wherever they went. <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses turn on the heathen nations that have had a part in Israel's demise. Edom (aka &quot;Idumea&quot;) gets special mention among these heathen nations in verse 5. Now that word has gotten to the exiles that Jerusalem has fallen to the Babylonians (<a title="Ezekiel 33 Summary" href="11-28.html#Watchman" target="_blank">Ezekiel 33:21, see notes</a>), they're all ears about when this exile is going to come to an end. Ezekiel gets right to the point in verse 8, &quot;But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are about to come.&quot; Finally...prosperity...at last! And the return to the homeland (Israel) is seen in verse 10, &quot;I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.&quot; We see the details of the promise of that restoration in verses 10-15.</p>
<p><b>It is important to note that restoration to the land is prophesied by both Jeremiah and Ezekiel in a couple of different contexts. </b>As we have stated many times, the exiles actually went back to their homeland under Persian rule in 535 B.C. However, at that time they were not an independent nation. In addition, the times-couldn't-be-better scenario of life back in the land found in this chapter has never existed - even to this day. <b>The prophecy of complete restoration and eternal prosperity won't really be manifested until the millennium. So in the numerous restoration prophecies found in the Old Testament, sometimes the prophets are talking about the simple return to their homeland in 535 B.C. and sometimes about the eternal prosperity of Israel in the homeland during the yet-future millennium.</b></p>
		<p>It's not all positive here though; in verses 16-21 Ezekiel carefully points out that even in exile, the Jews continue to disgrace the name of the Lord.</p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>Let's talk about restoration (Ezekiel 36:22-38)</b></font><br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">22 &para; &ldquo;Therefore say to the house of Israel, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;I do not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name&rsquo;s sake, which you have profaned among the nations wherever you went. <br>
		    23 And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD, &ldquo;when I am hallowed in you before their eyes. <br>
		    24 For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land. <br>
		    25 Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. <br>
		    26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. <br>
		    27 I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them.<br>
		    28 Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people, and I will be your God. <br>
		    29 I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you. <br>
		    30 And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations. <br>
		    31 Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations. <br>
		    32 Not for your sake do I do this,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD, &ldquo;let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!&rdquo; <br>
		    33 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also enable you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt. <br>
		    34 The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by. <br>
		    35 So they will say, &ldquo;This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.&rsquo; <br>
		    36 Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate. I, the LORD, have spoken it, and I will do it.&rdquo; <br>
		    37 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;I will also let the house of Israel inquire of Me to do this for them: I will increase their men like a flock. <br>
	      38 Like a flock offered as holy sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem on its feast days, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Why restore Israel? Verses 22-23 make it plain that restoration is necessary for God's sake - not Israel's. Here's a restoration of Israel, and verses 25-28 tell us that this is more than just the return in 535 B.C. under the Persians. <b>This is a national heart cleansing and times in Israel couldn't be better. </b>As a matter of fact, Jeremiah referred to this in <a title="Jeremiah 31 Summary" href="10-30.html#Covenant" target="_blank">Jeremiah 31:31-34 (see notes)</a> as the New Covenant. <b>The realization of the New Covenant is yet future - during the millennium.</b></p>
	<p><b>Notice particularly verse 35 &quot;This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden.&quot;</b> When Jews began to return to Israel in the early part of the 20th century, Israel was a wasteland. Today, vegetation is being grown where none existed for hundreds of years. <b>It's difficult to view the environment that now exists in Israel and make a case that it is anything other than the beginning of this prophesied restoration.</b> </p>

		    2 Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and indeed they were very dry. <br>
		    3 And He said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, can these bones live?&rdquo; &para; So I answered, &ldquo;O Lord GOD, You know.&rdquo; <br>
		    4 &para; Again He said to me, &ldquo;Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, &lsquo;O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD! <br>

	<p>You old timers will recognize that as the first line of an old Negro spiritual. Remember? &quot;The arm bone is connected to the shoulder bone,&quot; and so on. <b>This is actually one of the most fascinating chapters in all of the prophetic books.</b> It outlines the reconstituting of Israel out of nothing. According to the passage, the bones are the whole house of Israel, dispersed. They come together even though they are very dry. <b>Here's what's exciting about this: the first part of this prophecy happened on May 14, 1948 when Israel actually became an independent nation after over 2,500 years;</b> Jews migrated from all over the world back to their homeland in the years preceding that date...and afterward. </p>
		<p>Technically speaking, I'm comfortable with the notion that the &quot;shaking of the bones&quot; (verse 7) in this prophecy is a reference to World Wars I and II. Those wars changed the world's attitude toward the Jews and made it possible for Israel to become a nation in their original homeland. <b>However, this prophecy is not completely fulfilled until the New Covenant is established in the nation per the specifications of <a title="Jeremiah 31 Summary" href="10-30.html#Covenant" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> That consists of every inhabitant of Israel knowing and loving God personally - in their own, individual hearts. However, viewing the first step of this process in our lifetime is way exciting. </p>
		<p>Notice verses 22-23 tell us that Israel will be a false-worship-free zone at that time. But that's not all! We see in verses 24-28 the words &quot;forever&quot; and &quot;ever more&quot; used five times in talking about their new relationship with God. This is the millennium when the New Covenant will be completely fulfilled and the Messiah will rule. You will notice the reference to David in verse 24, &quot;David My servant shall be king over them.&quot; That did not happen in 535 B.C., but will in the yet-future millennium. As a matter of fact, the mention of David here is an interesting reference. For more details regarding David's role in the millennium, take a look at the information box provided above entitled, &quot;King David's Role in The Millennium.&quot; To read it in full screen, <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/David_Millennium.html" title="David in the Millennium" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
	<p><b>Perhaps it should be mentioned that the Mormon Church distorts a portion of this prophecy from chapter 37 for their own purposes. </b>Look at these verses:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>16 &ldquo;As for you, son of man, take a stick for yourself and write on it: &ldquo;For Judah and for the children of Israel, his companions.&rsquo; Then take another stick and write on it, &lsquo;For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, his companions.&rsquo; <br>
			    17 Then join them one to another for yourself into one stick, and they will become one in your hand. </p>
		  </blockquote>
	</blockquote>
		<p>The Mormons view the stick of Judah to be the Bible and the stick of Joseph (Smith) to be the Book of Mormon. And they happen to be the only church to unite them into one faith. That's a scary way to read the Old Testament. Actually, the sticks are representative of the Northern and Southern Kingdoms of Israel which had split after the reign of Solomon (<a href="8-20.html#Breaking" title="I Kings 12 Summary" target="_blank">I Kings 12, see notes</a>). In the millennium, all of Israel will once again be united. Some people really, really mistreat the Bible.</p>
