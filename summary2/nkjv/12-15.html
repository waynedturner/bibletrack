						<font size="4"><b>About the study of prophecy</b></font></div>
					<p><font size="3">My first serious study of Revelation began in 1973 when I was pastor of my first church. I went to the local Christian bookstore and bought the leading book on prophecy, &quot;Things To Come&quot; by J. Dwight Pentecost. Written in 1958; it still remains the leader of books on the subject of prophecy. Pentecost covers nearly all the prevalent views on the subject, and he explains why one view is to be preferred over another. The purpose of these summaries on Revelation is to provide a framework for studying the book. I'll generally just give you my thoughts and views on these passages, skipping the alternate views that I have dismissed as less likely. If you want to do and in-depth study of prophecy, I suggest that you start with a copy of &quot;Things To Come.&quot;</font></p>

<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, &ldquo;Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this.&rdquo; <br>
		    2 &para; Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. <br>
		    3 And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald. <br>
		    4 Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads. <br>
		    5 And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. <br>
		    6 &para; Before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. <br>
		    7 The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. <br>
		    8 The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying:<br>
&ldquo;Holy, holy, holy,<br>
Lord God Almighty,<br>
Who was and is and is to come!&rdquo; <br>
9 &para; Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, <br>
10 the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: <br>
11 	&ldquo;You are worthy, O Lord,<br>
To receive glory and honor and power;<br>
For You created all things,<br>
And by Your will they exist and were created.&rdquo;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><b>The events of chapters 4 and 5 all take place in Heaven; that much is certain.</b> I favor the position that the &quot;trumpet&quot; of verse 1 can probably be equated with the trumpet of <a title="I Thessalonians 4 Summary" href="9-10.html#Mystery" target="_blank">I Corinthians 15:52 (see notes)</a>, &quot;the trumpet shall sound.&quot; With that in mind, the events of Revelation 4-5 are most likely the events immediately following the rapture in Heaven. </p>
	<p><b><a name="Figurative"></a>We find a lot of figurative language in this chapter, so let's establish a key for understanding the scenario here in heaven:</b></p>
<ul>
			<li>God is the one on the throne
			  <br>
			His appearance here is similar to that of <a href="11-15.html#Visitor" title="Ezekiel 1 Summary" target="_blank">Ezekiel 1:26-28 (see notes)</a>.
			<li>The saints are represented by the 24 elders (<a href="#24">see more explanation below</a>)<br>
			<li>Jesus appears as the Lamb in 5:5-6 (<a href="#Still">see below</a>). 
              <br>
  There he is described in his Messianic context as, &quot;the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David.&quot;
  <li>The crowns thrown &quot;before the throne&quot; in this passage are likely the rewards given to Believers for their works as depicted in <a title="I Corinthians 3 Summary" href="8-29.html#Rewards" target="_blank">I Corinthians 3:11-15 (see notes)</a>.<br>
    We do find mention of five specific crowns in the New Testament epistles.
      Perhaps those are related to the crowns found in this passage.
      <ol>
        <li>An &quot;incorruptible&quot; crown in <a href="9-2.html#Apostle" title="I Corinthians 9 Summary" target="_blank">I Corinthians 9:24-25 (see notes)</a>.</li>
        <li>A &quot;crown of rejoicing&quot; in <a href="10-20.html#Crown" title="I Thessalonians 2 Summary" target="_blank">I Thessalonians 2:19-20 (see notes)</a>.</li>
        <li>A &quot;crown of righteousness&quot; in <a href="11-1.html#Ready" title="II Timothy 4 Summary" target="_blank">II Timothy 4:6-8 (see notes)</a>.</li>
        <li>A &quot;crown of life&quot; in <a href="11-21.html#Trial" title="James 1 Summary" target="_blank">James 1:12 (see notes)</a>.</li>
        <li>A &quot;crown of glory&quot; in <a href="11-25.html#Elders" title="I Peter 5 Summary" target="_blank">I Peter 5:2-4 (see notes)</a>.<br>
            </li>
    </ol>  
  </ul>
	<p><a name="24"></a>While we don't know for certain, let's list some reasons why the 24 elders likely represent the saints. These 24 elders are wearing white robes, crowns of gold and are singing a song of redemption in 5:9-10 (<a href="12-31.html#Jerusalem" title="Revelation 21 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 21:12-14 (see notes)</a> where the New Jerusalem is described, &quot;Also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&quot; Notice the 12 Old Testament Tribes along with the 12 New Testament Apostles. The math works for the Old Testament and New Testament saints to be represented here by the 24 elders.</p>
	<p><b>So...if the above assumptions are correct regarding the identity of the 24 elders and the crowns, here's the future scenario: </b>Immediately following the rapture of Believers, they will appear before God at the Judgment Seat (<a title="II Corinthians 5 Summary" href="8-29.html#Rewards" target="_blank">I Corinthians 3:11-15, see notes</a>). The reward for their good works will be in the form of crowns which will be cast at the feet of Jesus (Revelation 4:10).</p>
	<p><b>What about the &quot;four creatures.&quot;</b> The actual Greek word used here for &quot;creatures&quot; is &quot;dzo&acute;-on.&quot; It's a neuter-gender noun from the same root as the verb form translated &quot;to live.&quot; It's not used in a negative connotation here, but simply should be viewed as &quot;living things.&quot; We don't have much to go on in determining their identities, but they are participants in the events of the tribulation and appear frequently (Revelation 4:6, 7, 8, 9, 5:6, 8, 11, 14, 6:1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7:11, 14:3, 15:7, 19:4). They are involved in the announcement of the seal openings (first four seals) in Revelation 6 (<a href="#Life">see below</a>) and are seen around the throne in Heaven in chapter 5 along with the worshipping elders there. In 7:11 and 19:4 they are seen worshipping God along with the elders. In 15:7 one of them is seen disbursing the seven vial judgments to the seven angels there. So...we still don't know who they are, but we do know that they will be busy in Heaven as assistants during the tribulation.</p>
  <p><font size="4"><b><a name="Still"></a>We're still in Heaven (Revelation 5)</b></font><br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals. <br>
		    2 Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &ldquo;Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose its seals?&rdquo; <br>
		    3 And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it. <br>
		    4 &para; So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. <br>
		    5 But one of the elders said to me, &ldquo;Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals.&rdquo; <br>
		    6 &para; And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth. <br>
		    7 Then He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. <br>
		    8 &para; Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. <br>
		    9 And they sang a new song, saying:<br>
&ldquo;You are worthy to take the scroll,<br>
And to open its seals;<br>
For You were slain,<br>
And have redeemed us to God by Your blood<br>
Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, <br>
10 	And have made us kings and priests to our God;<br>
And we shall reign on the earth.&rdquo; <br>
11 &para; Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, <br>
12 saying with a loud voice:<br>
&ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb who was slain<br>
To receive power and riches and wisdom,<br>
And strength and honor and glory and blessing!&rdquo; <br>
13 &para; And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying:<br>
&ldquo;Blessing and honor and glory and power<br>
Be to Him who sits on the throne,<br>
And to the Lamb, forever and ever!&rdquo; <br>
14 &para; Then the four living creatures said, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives forever and ever. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>A view of the judging God and the sacrificial lamb is seen in Heaven in this chapter. Life on earth during the tribulation does not start until chapter 6 (<a href="#Life">see below</a>). All of these events of chapter 5 take place in Heaven and are a continuation of chapter 4 (<a href="#Figurative">see above</a>). The same characters are found in chapter 5 as chapter 4 (<a href="#Figurative">see above</a>). Verses 1-8 deal with the opening of the book of judgments that begin to unfold on earth in chapter 6 (<a href="#Life">see below</a>). </p>
		<p>You will notice in verse 5 that the book has seven seals. These seals each represent a particular judgment...the judgments that begin in chapter 6 where we see six of the seven seal judgments revealed. The seventh is opened in Revelation 8:1 (<a href="12-23.html#Tribulation" title="Revelation 16 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 16 (see notes)</a>.</p>
		<p>Verses 9-14 introduce a Heavenly song; it looks as though we'll be learning a new song in verses 9-10; it's a song of redemption of sinners saved by grace. While God and Jesus Christ are one, the two aspects of God as judge (on the throne) and sin payment (the lamb) are seen in this chapter. The &quot;creatures&quot; (aka &quot;living creatures&quot;) are seen in these proceedings; they are involved in the worship of &quot;the Lamb.&quot; There is no question regarding the identity of the &quot;Lamb&quot; here; he's Jesus himself. We see that only Jesus is worthy to open the book which contains the judgments to follow. He's described in his Messianic context as, &quot;the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David.&quot;</p>
		<p>Regarding the description of the &quot;Lamb&quot; in verse eight, to know that it is Jesus is all that can actually be known for certain based upon scripture. His description here as &quot;having seven horns and seven eyes&quot; is interesting, but to explain the significance would be conjecture. While a certain amount of educated speculation seems necessary at times while studying Revelation, knowing the significance of the horns and eyes described here doesn't alter the fact that it's still a description of Jesus.</p>

		  <p><font size="2">1 Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo; <br>
		    2 And I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer. <br>
		    3 &para; When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo; <br>
		    4 Another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that people should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword. <br>
		    5 &para; When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo; So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. <br>
		    6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, &ldquo;A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.&rdquo; <br>
		    7 &para; When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo; <br>
		    8 So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth. <br>
		    9 &para; When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. <br>
		    10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&rdquo; <br>
		    11 Then a white robe was given to each of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed.  <br>

		<p>This chapter contains six of the seven judgments referred to in Revelation as the &quot;seal judgments.&quot; These judgments come from the &quot;book&quot; discussed in Revelation 5:1-8 (<a href="10-24.html#Tribulation" target="_blank">II Thessalonians 2, see notes</a>). This first 3 1/2 years is a relatively peaceful time with the world still digesting the disappearance of the Believers who were raptured out (<a href="#Heaven">see chapter 4 notes</a>). It is most commonly believed that the four horsemen span this period, and the transition of conditions on earth during the first 3 1/2 years is seen with these successive horsemen. </p>
	<p><b>With that figurative scenario in mind, the four horsemen represent the following:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Horseman #1 (Verse 2): Peace at the hand of the conquering Antichrist 
			  <br>
		  Many prophecy teachers point to the fact that this horseman has a bow but no arrows as an indicator that he's really a warrior, but conquering through negotiations rather than violence. The desecration of the temple marks the beginning of the reign of terror by the &quot;beast,&quot; and we are told in (<a title="Daniel 9 Summary" href="12-12.html#Weeks" target="_blank">Daniel 9:24, see notes)</a> that this takes place at the 3 1/2 year point in the tribulation. Some see Jesus on this first horse, but that doesn't actually fit the scenario.
		  <li>Horseman #2 (Verse 3): Followed by violence 
		      <br>
		  People begin to turn on each other.<li>Horseman #3 (Verses 4-5): Followed by famine 
		    <br>
		  The violence brings on famine.<li>Horseman #4 (Verses 7-8): Followed by death  
	        <br>
    The famine brings on death.
		</ul>
	<p><strong>Keep in mind that these are conjectures regarding the symbolism of verses 2-8.</strong> These four horsemen provide a sequence of events that begin in the first half of the tribulation, but may continue throughout the seven-year period. There is an interesting parallel between these four horsemen and Jesus' sequential outlining of the events during the tribulation in <a href="5-17.html#Question" title="Matthew 24 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 24 (see notes)</a>. Notice the comparison of passages in the table below:</p>

	<p>Verses 9-11 display the words of those who were slain, presumably by the godless beast (aka &quot;antichrist&quot;), as it is assumed that he will garner his world-wide influence and authority over the first 3 1/2 years of the tribulation. This assumption is based upon our knowledge that the tribulation period is 7 years and that the midpoint (3 1/2 years) is referenced in Daniel as the time that the beast breaks a covenant he previously established with Israel, also seen in <a title="II Thessalonians 2 Summary" href="10-24.html#Tribulation" target="_blank">II Thessalonians 2 (see notes)</a>. Therefore, there can be no serious challenge to the notion that the beast (aka &quot;antichrist&quot;) plays a prominent role in the first 3 1/2 years of the tribulation period.</p>

	<p><strong>Chapter 6 gets really interesting in verses 12-17. There's volcanic activity and an earthquake which wipes out some armies in the mountains around Jerusalem. </strong>And what causes this cataclysmic activity? Whatever it is, it darkens the appearance of the sun and moon - sounds like an asteroid strike doesn't it? That could cause havoc!

	<p>After chapter 6, our Revelation timeline is interrupted for an identity check of these 144,000 witnesses who appear in chapter 7. Who are these people? Immediately after all Believers are raptured to Heaven (pre-tribulation rapture position), there will be a brief time when no Believers are present on the earth. After a short time (How short? No one knows.), 144,000 Jewish men will miraculously get saved and become witnesses to the world, preaching salvation in Christ.</p>
		<p>The term &quot;after these things&quot; (verse 1) refers to the sequence in which John saw these &quot;four angels,&quot; not the sequence in which it takes place within the tribulation period. The term &quot;wind&quot; (Greek: anemos) seems to be a metaphor for judgments poured out on the earth. There is a lull in action while these servants are sealed.</p>
	<p><b>Here's what we know from scripture about the 144,000 witnesses:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sealed from harm (Revelation 7:4) with God's name (<a title="Revelation 14 Summary" href="12-23.html#Facts" target="_blank">Revelation 14:1, see notes</a>)
			<li>12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of Israel (Revelation 7:5-8)
			  <br>
		  We do not know why there is a variation of the listing of the tribes here. Dan is omitted. The twelve is thus rounded out by listing Joseph and his son Manasseh.
		  <li>They preach the salvation message (Revelation 7:9-11)
			<li>They are all men (<a title="Revelation 14 Summary" href="12-23.html#Facts" target="_blank">Revelation 14:4, see notes</a>)
			<li>They serve to fulfill <a title="Romans 11 Summary" href="8-21.html#Fulness" target="_blank">Romans 11:25-27 (see notes)</a> in the salvation of Israel.		</ul>
	<p><b>Chapter 7 is not sequential in the outlining of events of the tribulation. It's a parenthetical chapter that explains events that characterize the entire seven-year period.</b> The sequence of tribulation events resumes in chapter 8.</p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>A great multitude - saved (Revelation 7:9-17)</b></font><br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">9 &para; After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands, <br>
		    10 and crying out with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!&rdquo; <br>
		    11 All the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, <br>
		    12 saying:<br>
&ldquo;Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom,<br>
Thanksgiving and honor and power and might,<br>
Be to our God forever and ever.<br>
Amen.&rdquo; <br>
13 &para; Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, &ldquo;Who are these arrayed in white robes, and where did they come from?&rdquo; <br>
14 &para; And I said to him, &ldquo;Sir, you know.&rdquo; &para; So he said to me, &ldquo;These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. <br>
15 Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will dwell among them. <br>
16 They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any heat; <br>
17 for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&rdquo; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>These are the people who get saved during the tribulation, apparently as a result of the ministry of the 144,000 witnesses of verses 1-8. The influence of these witnesses will be world wide. These are the saved who came out of &quot;great tribulation.&quot; Jesus uses the term &quot;great tribulation&quot; to describe the period after the manifestation of the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; in <a title="Matthew 24 Summary" href="5-17.html#Antichrist" target="_blank">Matthew 24:21 (see notes)</a>. <strong>Thus we conclude that the &quot;great tribulation&quot; is a term used to differentiate the last half of the tribulation from the first half.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>A popular assessment regarding the identity of these people is that they are the ones who died as Believers during the tribulation. </strong>The conditions before the throne (verse 9) seem to be a picture of conditions in Heaven rather than the millennium. However, we aren't actually told that they die during the tribulation, and there's a slight problem with that understanding. We are told in verse 14, &quot;<font size="3">These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&quot;</font> These are more likely those who endure to the end of the tribulation and move on to populate the millennium. As a matter of fact, verse 15 says that they will serve &quot;in his temple.&quot; The New Jerusalem has no temple according to <a href="12-2.html#Temple" title="Ezekiel 40 Summary" target="_blank">Ezekiel 40, see notes</a>) will be erected.</p>

		    3 Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. <br>
		    4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel&rsquo;s hand. <br>
		    5 Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth. And there were noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake. <br>
	      6 &para; So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><b>One of my Bible teachers contended that verse 1 proves there are no women in Heaven when it says &quot;When He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.&quot;</b> LIGHTEN UP! IT'S A JOKE - A PREACHER'S JOKE! Actually, I heard that from Professor Emerson Pent, back in 1971. He passed away years ago, so let him rest in peace. The silence is likely in anticipation of the terrible judgments immediately in store for the earth. What we do have in verse 1 is the seventh seal judgment. All of the other six seals were opened and explained in chapter 6 (<a href="5-17.html#Antichrist" target="_blank">Matthew 24:15 (see notes)</a> that it is at the midpoint of the seven-year period when the beast (aka &quot;antichrist&quot;) breaks his covenant with Israel. This is that point in time.</p>
	<p>Who are these &quot;saints&quot; (verse 3) and what are their prayers? This is the first of two references to the &quot;golden altar.&quot; These &quot;saints&quot; undoubtedly are the saved on earth during the tribulation. If you were saved during the tribulation, what would you be praying? The prayers go up and judgment, as a result, begins. So...the seven trumpet judgments follow as a result of the prayers of the tribulation saints.</p>
	<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Trumpets"></a>The first four trumpet judgments (Revelation 8:7-12)</b></font><br>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">7 &para; The first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up. <br>
	    8 &para; Then the second angel sounded: And something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. <br>
	    9 And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. <br>
	    10 &para; Then the third angel sounded: And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. <br>
	    11 The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the water, because it was made bitter. <br>
      12 &para; Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Get the picture: The relatively calm period of the tribulation (first 3 1/2 years) comes to a close at the end of chapter 6 (<a href="10-24.html#Tribulation" target="_blank">II Thessalonians 2, see notes</a>). Now, as for the second half of the tribulation - it's horrific! <b>Something cataclysmic happens on earth as described by these first four trumpet judgments.</b></p>
	<p>We see four of the seven trumpet judgments briefly described here:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>&quot;Hail and fire mingled with blood...thrown down to the earth&quot;<br>
	    Vegetation is burned up.<br>
	  </li>
      <li>&quot;A great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea&quot;<br>
        Something from above falls into and poisons the seas.<br>
      </li>
	  <li>&quot;a great star fell from heaven&quot;<br>
	  Something from above falls into and poisons fresh water supplies.</li>
	  <li>&quot;a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars&quot;<br>
	    The light emitted by the celestial bodies are diminished by one-third. This could be related to atmospheric conditions i.e. particles in the air.</li>
    </ol>
	<p>When I read verses 7-12, it reminds me of the results we are frequently warned about if one of those asteroids our government tracks actually were to collide with the earth. I think it is legitimate to guess that perhaps the earth is struck by an asteroid to bring about this level of destruction. With the particles in the air, it is reasonable to conclude that the light from the sun and moon would be diminished by one third as well. Of course the waters would be contaminated and the land scorched. Perhaps this is a follow up to the same natural phenomenon seen in Revelation 6:12-17 (<a href="#Cataclysm">see above</a>).</p>
<p><a name="Woes"></a><font size="4"><b>The three woes aren't just rhetoric (Revelation 8:13)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">13 &para; And I looked, and I heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, &ldquo;Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!&rdquo; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><b>After chapter 8 there are still 3 trumpet judgments.</b> They are referred to here when the angel says, &quot;Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!&quot; <b>These &quot;three woes&quot; enumerate the last three trumpet judgments.</b> After the fifth trumpet judgment, it is said in <a href="12-19.html#Trumpets">Revelation 11:14 (see notes)</a>, &quot;The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.&quot; So, as you can see, the wording in verse 13 is quite significant; the tribulation is going to get MUCH WORSE!</p>
	<p><b>Don't let it get you down; Believers will already be gone in the rapture when all of this takes place.</b></p>
