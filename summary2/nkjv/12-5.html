<p><a name="Gate"></a><font size="4"><b>That special eastern gate (Ezekiel 44:1-14)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Then He brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces toward the east, but it was shut. <br>
    2 And the LORD said to me, &ldquo;This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, because the LORD God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut. <br>
    3 As for the prince, because he is the prince, he may sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway, and go out the same way.&rdquo; <br>
    4 &para; Also He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple; so I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD; and I fell on my face. <br>
    5 And the LORD said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears, all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD and all its laws. Mark well who may enter the house and all who go out from the sanctuary. <br>
    6 &para; &ldquo;Now say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;O house of Israel, let Us have no more of all your abominations. <br>
    7 When you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to defile it&mdash;My house&mdash;and when you offered My food, the fat and the blood, then they broke My covenant because of all your abominations. <br>
    8 And you have not kept charge of My holy things, but you have set others to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.&rdquo; <br>
    9 Thus says the Lord GOD: &ldquo;No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter My sanctuary, including any foreigner who is among the children of Israel. <br>
    10 &para; &ldquo;And the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray, who strayed away from Me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity. <br>
    11 Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, as gatekeepers of the house and ministers of the house; they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them. <br>
    12 Because they ministered to them before their idols and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore I have raised My hand in an oath against them,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD, &ldquo;that they shall bear their iniquity. <br>
    13 And they shall not come near Me to minister to Me as priest, nor come near any of My holy things, nor into the Most Holy Place; but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed. <br>
    14 Nevertheless I will make them keep charge of the temple, for all its work, and for all that has to be done in it.  <br>

<p>Only the prince will use this gate. Who is the prince in chapters 44, 45, 46 and 48? After very carefully examining this issue over a period of time, I can only conclude that <b>this prince IS NOT the Messiah.</b> You will see in these last four chapters obvious reasons why this &quot;prince&quot; is not a reference to Christ, and can't be. For starters, consider this: <b>this &quot;prince&quot; makes a sin offering for himself in 45:22 </b>(<a href="11-30.html#Bones" target="_blank">Ezekiel 37:24-25 (see notes)</a>; there he is - David. You'll see in the following chapters that this prince is entirely human. Can you say &quot;resurrected King David?&quot; However, many scholars hold to the notion that a mention of David as a millennial leader is actually a reference to a descendant of David. <b>Apparently Ezekiel's prophecy envisioned David (or a descendant) as the civil leader under the authority of the Messiah. Very few commentators even acknowledge the fact that this prince is not a reference to the Messiah, but it is clear that he is not.</b> Most commentators gloss over the clear references to David and these issues that are raised here regarding the &quot;prince&quot; and pay the subject little attention.</p>
<p><b>To summarize regarding this &quot;prince,&quot; consider the following:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Prince will be a leader within Israel in the messianic era.&nbsp; 
			<li>He will be fully human.<br>
				Makes a sin offering for himself (Ezekiel 45:22, <a href="#Sacrificing">see below</a>)<br>
				May have descendants (<a href="12-6.html#Prince" title="Ezekiel 46 Summary" target="_blank">Ezekiel 46:16, see notes</a>)
			<li>He will own a tribal-sized plot of land encompassing the temple grounds (<a href="12-6.html#Land" title="Ezekiel 48 Summary" target="_blank">Ezekiel 48:21-22, see notes</a>).&nbsp;
			<li>He will have a unique relationship with regard to the temple where he will be performing some priestly functions (Ezekiel 45:16-17, 22 - <a href="12-6.html#Prince" title="Ezekiel 46 Summary" target="_blank">Ezekiel 46:4, 12 -  see notes</a>)
		</ul>
	<p>It is, therefore, clear that Ezekiel saw a leader in addition to the Messiah (Jesus) who will serve in this leadership capacity. It can only be surmised that there will be the Messiah (Jesus) during the millennium with David or a descendant of David serving under him. <a title="Ezekiel 46 Summary" href="12-6.html" target="_blank">Click here to read additional comments on this issue from the Ezekiel 46 notes.</a></p>
		<p><b>Then, in verses 6 through 14, we get a special rebuke for the past practices of Israel in that they allowed pagans and pagan worship to take place in the previous temple.</b> Here we have some very specific instructions designed to keep that from happening again. Remember, during the millennium a host of Gentile people will be born who will not choose to partake of the salvation in Christ. These are those strangers spoken of here. We also notice a narrowing of the Levitical priesthood. Only those of a particular lineage, that of Zadok, are allowed to serve as actual priests. The others will do temple maintenance. This isn't really unique to the millennium; the prophetic decree was actually issued back in <a title="I Samuel 2 Summary" href="3-27.html#Women" target="_blank">Numbers 25:11-13 (see notes)</a> where it was decreed that priests from that time forward would come only from the line of Aaron's grandson, Phinehas. Not even Eli in I Samuel was a descendant of Phinehas; that prophecy took a long time before fulfillment, but it was fulfilled. Well...those prophetic restrictions continue right on into the millennium.</p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>Special instructions for these priests (Ezekiel 44:15-31)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">15 &para; &ldquo;But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer to Me the fat and the blood,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD. <br>
		    16 &ldquo;They shall enter My sanctuary, and they shall come near My table to minister to Me, and they shall keep My charge. <br>
		    17 And it shall be, whenever they enter the gates of the inner court, that they shall put on linen garments; no wool shall come upon them while they minister within the gates of the inner court or within the house. <br>
		    18 They shall have linen turbans on their heads and linen trousers on their bodies; they shall not clothe themselves with anything that causes sweat. <br>
		    19 When they go out to the outer court, to the outer court to the people, they shall take off their garments in which they have ministered, leave them in the holy chambers, and put on other garments; and in their holy garments they shall not sanctify the people. <br>
		    20 &para; &ldquo;They shall neither shave their heads, nor let their hair grow long, but they shall keep their hair well trimmed. <br>
		    21 No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court. <br>
		    22 They shall not take as wife a widow or a divorced woman, but take virgins of the descendants of the house of Israel, or widows of priests. <br>
		    23 &para; &ldquo;And they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the unholy, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. <br>
		    24 In controversy they shall stand as judges, and judge it according to My judgments. They shall keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed meetings, and they shall hallow My Sabbaths. <br>
		    25 &para; &ldquo;They shall not defile themselves by coming near a dead person. Only for father or mother, for son or daughter, for brother or unmarried sister may they defile themselves. <br>
		    26 After he is cleansed, they shall count seven days for him. <br>
		    27 And on the day that he goes to the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, he must offer his sin offering in the inner court,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD. <br>
		    28 &para; &ldquo;It shall be, in regard to their inheritance, that I am their inheritance. You shall give them no possession in Israel, for I am their possession. <br>
		    29 They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs. <br>
		    30 The best of all firstfruits of any kind, and every sacrifice of any kind from all your sacrifices, shall be the priest&rsquo;s; also you shall give to the priest the first of your ground meal, to cause a blessing to rest on your house. <br>
	      31 The priests shall not eat anything, bird or beast, that died naturally or was torn by wild beasts.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>We see the service requirements for these priests outlined here. These millennial priests will still be expected to present themselves before the people as examples of righteous living. Specific instructions for doing so are listed here. There is a teaching ministry required of these priests as well in verse 23, &quot;And they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the unholy, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.&quot; We then see in verse 24 that these priests will have a hand in judging during the millennium. And...they'll live off the provisions from the people they serve.</p>
	<p>One can't help but notice the similarities of the activities of these millennial priests to that of the Aaronic priests as outlined in <a href="2-28.html" title="Leviticus 1 Summary" target="_blank">Leviticus 1 through 7 (see notes)</a>. Many of the specifications are the same or similar. Of course, back then those sacrifices were anticipating the day when sins would once and for all be atoned for, whereas we conclude that these millennial sacrifices will serve as a memorial of what Jesus has done for the entire world.</p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Zoning issues in the millennium (Ezekiel 45:1-8)</b></font><br>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;Moreover, when you divide the land by lot into inheritance, you shall set apart a district for the LORD, a holy section of the land; its length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits, and the width ten thousand. It shall be holy throughout its territory all around. <br>
	    2 Of this there shall be a square plot for the sanctuary, five hundred by five hundred rods, with fifty cubits around it for an open space. <br>
	    3 So this is the district you shall measure: twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide; in it shall be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.<br>
	    4 It shall be a holy section of the land, belonging to the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the LORD; it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. <br>
	    5 An area twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide shall belong to the Levites, the ministers of the temple; they shall have twenty chambers as a possession. <br>
	    6 &para; &ldquo;You shall appoint as the property of the city an area five thousand cubits wide and twenty-five thousand long, adjacent to the district of the holy section; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel. <br>
	    7 &para; &ldquo;The prince shall have a section on one side and the other of the holy district and the city&rsquo;s property; and bordering on the holy district and the city&rsquo;s property, extending westward on the west side and eastward on the east side, the length shall be side by side with one of the tribal portions, from the west border to the east border. <br>
	    8 The land shall be his possession in Israel; and My princes shall no more oppress My people, but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel, according to their tribes.&rdquo; <br>
	  </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Here are some additional zoning issues being settled for the holy district around the temple grounds. There's a piece of property about six miles by eight miles that surrounds the temple, and the priests surround the temple on this land. Additionally, the prince's area extends beyond this, both to the east and to the west, another 8 miles or so.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Sacrificing"></a>Let the sacrificing begin (Ezekiel 45:9-25)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">9 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;Enough, O princes of Israel! Remove violence and plundering, execute justice and righteousness, and stop dispossessing My people,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD. <br>
    10 &ldquo;You shall have honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath. <br>
    11 The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, so that the bath contains one-tenth of a homer, and the ephah one-tenth of a homer; their measure shall be according to the homer. <br>
    12 The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be your mina. <br>
    13 &para; &ldquo;This is the offering which you shall offer: you shall give one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley. <br>
    14 The ordinance concerning oil, the bath of oil, is one-tenth of a bath from a kor. A kor is a homer or ten baths, for ten baths are a homer. <br>
    15 And one lamb shall be given from a flock of two hundred, from the rich pastures of Israel. These shall be for grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD. <br>
    16 &ldquo;All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel. <br>
    17 Then it shall be the prince&rsquo;s part to give burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings, at the feasts, the New Moons, the Sabbaths, and at all the appointed seasons of the house of Israel. He shall prepare the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.&rdquo; <br>
    18 &para; &ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD: &lsquo;In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary. <br>
    19 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the gate of the inner court. <br>
    20 And so you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who has sinned unintentionally or in ignorance. Thus you shall make atonement for the temple. <br>
    21 &para; &ldquo;In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall observe the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. <br>
    22 And on that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering. <br>
    23 On the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bulls and seven rams without blemish, daily for seven days, and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering. <br>
    24 And he shall prepare a grain offering of one ephah for each bull and one ephah for each ram, together with a hin of oil for each ephah. <br>
  25 &para; &ldquo;In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall do likewise for seven days, according to the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the oil.&rdquo; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even with Jesus as the Messiah during the millennium, sacrificing will resume. <a title="Ezekiel 43 Summary" href="12-31.html#Millennium" title="Revelation 20 Summary" target="_blank">Revelation 20:8 (see notes)</a>. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the Passover Feast will be observed (verses 21-24) during the millennium just as in the Old Testament, complete with the lamb and unleavened bread for seven days.Then, in the seventh month, the Feast of Tabernacles (Booths) will be celebrated. <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Feasts.html" title="Jewish Feasts" target="_blank">For more information on these festivals, click here.</a></p>
