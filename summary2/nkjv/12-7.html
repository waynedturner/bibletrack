		    4 &para; I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father. <br>
		    5 And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another. <br>
		    6 This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it. <br>
		    7 &para; For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. <br>

    </blockquote>
	<p>Here's a second and separate letter from John. He reinforces his theme of First John. Nobody knows the identity, specifically, to whom this letter is addressed. She is simply referred to as &quot;elect lady.&quot; However, the purpose of the letter is very clear. As in his first epistle (<a title="I John Summary" href="12-3.html#Introduction" target="_blank">I John, see notes</a>), John is still dealing with the same false doctrines in this second epistle. His emphasis on &quot;truth&quot; in verses 1, 2 and 4 emphasizes the errant nature of two particular characteristics of the doctrine he is combating - that Jesus Christ did not come in the flesh (verse 7) and the dismissal of the importance of brotherly love (verses 5-6). These characteristics of errant teaching were prominent in John's first epistle as well.</p>
	<p>I think verses 9-11 offer a significant enhancement to his words in <a title="I John Summary" href="12-3.html#Introduction" target="_blank">I John (see notes)</a>. II John 9-11 says, &quot;Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son. <b>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him; for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.&quot;</b> Well, so much for political correctness - John says that we should treat false teachers with ZERO hospitality.</p>
	<p><b>Just how serious was this errant teaching?</b> There's your answer in verse 7, &quot;For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a <strong>deceiver</strong> and an <strong>antichrist</strong>.&quot; These false teachers were teaching something other than the deity of Jesus Christ and his fulfillment of the requirements of Messiahship.<b> These Biblical truths may not be denied while retaining fellowship with Believers. </b>Interestingly enough, John is the only writer in the Bible to use the term &quot;antichrist&quot; - once here and three times in his first epistle. John had previously written in <a href="12-3.html#False" title="I John 4 Summary" target="_blank">I John 4:2-3 (see notes)</a>, &quot;By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.&quot; We get a glimpse of these particular false prophets' message in verse 2 when he says, <font size="3">&quot;Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God.&quot;</font> The inverse is stated in verse 3. These false prophets obviously preached a message that Jesus was all spirit - no flesh - a gnostic doctrine. <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Gnosticism.html" title="Gnosticism" target="_blank">For more information on gnosticism, click here.</a> Here's the point: Jesus came as the Messiah...the flesh and blood Messiah. To teach that Jesus was anything less than that is heresy.</p>
	<p>Let me clarify something. This is not the only doctrinal issue for which denial should cause Believers to break fellowship; there are others, and we typically call them the fundamentals of our faith.</p>
		<p><b>What are the fundamentals of our faith?</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Inspiration of scripture
			<li>Deity, virgin birth and bodily resurrection of Jesus
			<li>Salvation by grace alone through the shed blood of Jesus Christ on the cross
			<li>The physical return of Jesus Christ
			<li>The existence of a literal Heaven and Hell 
		</ul>
		<p><b>John's second epistle focuses primarily on just one of these fundamentals, the identity of Jesus Christ.</b> It was obviously the fundamental widely under attack among the recipients of John's second epistle. You will notice in verse 4 that John commends them for &quot;walking in truth.&quot; However, as seen in verses 9-11, he's concerned about these false teachers wearing away at their spiritual resolve. When Believers entertain faith-threatening doctrines, it's a faith-weakening experience; discouragement follows and joy is arrested. How many Believers do you know who have fallen out of close fellowship with God and other Believers over a discouraging set of circumstances regarding their walk with the Lord? John issues a warning of the consequences in verse 8, &quot;Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but <strong>that we may receive a full reward.</strong>&quot; LOSE WHAT!? He's not talking about salvation, but rather rewards at the Judgment Seat of Christ (<a title="II Corinthians 5 Summary" href="8-29.html#Rewards" target="_blank"> I Corinthians 3:11-15 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Workers"></a><font size="4"><b>Dealing with the evil workers (III John)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 The Elder, &para; To the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth: <br>
		    2 &para; Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers. <br>
		    3 For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, just as you walk in the truth. <br>
		    4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. <br>
		    5 &para; Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers, <br>
		    6 who have borne witness of your love before the church. If you send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, you will do well, <br>
		    7 because they went forth for His name&rsquo;s sake, taking nothing from the Gentiles. <br>
		    8 We therefore ought to receive such, that we may become fellow workers for the truth. <br>
		    9 &para; I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us. <br>
		    10 Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church. <br>
		    11 &para; Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God. <br>
		    12 &para; Demetrius has a good testimony from all, and from the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true. <br>
		    13 &para; I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink; <br>
	      14 but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. &para; Peace to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>John's taking on the teaching of false doctrine here once again. He dealt with these same issues in <a title="I John Summary" href="12-3.html#Introduction" target="_blank">I John (see notes)</a> as well as II John (<a href="#Warning">see above</a>). We don't really know anything about Gaius, the man to whom the letter was addressed. Obviously he is influential in the church there. The key verse here is 4, &quot;I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.&quot; As a matter of fact, the word &quot;truth&quot; is used six times and &quot;true&quot; once in these 14 verses. John is not expressing doctrinal opinions in degrees here; doctrines are either true or false. It is worth noting that this letter is written specifically to Gaius for delivery to the church. Apparently John's communications to the church had previously been blocked by a man named Diotrephes (verse 9) there. It would appear that this epistle serves as a warning against this man and his teaching.</p>
	<p><b>What do we know about this evil man, Diotrephes?</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>He &quot;loveth to have the preeminence&quot; (verse 9).			<li>He prevented John's communications with the church (verse 9).			<li>With regard to John himself, Diotrephes was guilty of &quot;prating against us with malicious words&quot; (verse 10)			<li>He prevented others from receiving John and other brethren in Christ (verse 10).			<li>He excommunicated from the church those who received John and the other brethren in Christ (verse 10).		</ul>
		<p>And what about this man, Diotrephes, teaching false doctrine. Notice verse 11, &quot;Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God.&quot; That's a similar warning to the one he gave in II John 9-11 (<a href="#Warnings">see above</a>). The phrase in that verse, &quot;he who does evil,&quot; is one word in Greek &quot;kakopoieo,&quot; and it's a present active participle specifying continuing action. <b>This false teacher continually practices evil.</b> John is harsh toward false teaching, but <b>Jude goes into greater detail regarding the false teacher's motivation </b>(<a href="#Warning">see below</a>)<b>.</b> John closes with his intentions to come for a visit and straighten things out.</p>
<p><a name="Warning"></a><font size="4"><b>A warning against apostasy (Jude) </b></font><br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, &para; To those who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ: <br>
		    2 &para; Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you. <br>
	        </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>This epistle was written by Jude - probably the Jude who was the half-brother of Jesus. The date of writing is somewhere between 40-80 A.D. It's a letter to Believers, as seen in verses 1-2. Jude ascribes three attributes to Believers:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Sanctified - Greek: &quot;hagiazo&quot; (verb) means &quot;to set apart&quot; or &quot;to make holy&quot;<br>
		    As a matter of fact, the Greek noun form of that root is &quot;hagios,&quot; which is often translated &quot;saints.&quot; In other words, a Believer is &quot;set apart&quot; for an eternity in Heaven as a &quot;saint&quot; of God. </li>
		  <li>Preserved - Greek &quot;tereo&quot; (verb) means &quot;to keep or guard&quot;<br>
		    After salvation, the Holy Spirit indwells Believers and seals their salvation eternally. <a title="II Corinthians 1 Summary" href="9-14.html#Work" target="_blank">See notes on II Corinthians 1:21-24 for further details.</a>          </li>
		  <li>Called - Greek: &quot;kletos&quot; (adjective) means &quot;invited&quot; or &quot;chosen&quot;<br>
		    Jesus said in <a title="John 6 Summary" href="3-10.html#Bread" target="_blank">John 6:44 (see notes)</a>, &quot;No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.&quot; This is the process whereby the Holy Spirit convicts one of sin, thus prompting them to receive Jesus Christ as one's Savior. </li>
    </ul>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">3 &para; Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. <br>
		    4 For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. <br>
	      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><b>Verses 3-4 give Jude's purpose for writing this epistle: </b></p>
		<blockquote>
          <p> Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. <strong>For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><b>AVOID APOSTATES!</b> That's Jude's warning here. Persevere in the faith! Notice the severe tone Jude takes with these false teachers. It's a no-mercy book about dealing with these wicked people.</p>
		<p>Jude uses the term &quot;common salvation&quot; to describe the vehicle whereby Believers are counted righteous before God. The Greek adjective &quot;koinos&quot; is only used ten times in the New Testament - most often to describe that which is unclean by conventional standards. Jews considered Gentiles &quot;common,&quot; as seen in Peter's experience with the Gentiles of Cornelius' household in <a title="Acts 10 Summary" href="12-3.html#Introduction" target="_blank">I John (see notes)</a> as well as II John (<a href="#Warning">see above</a>) and III John (<a href="#Workers">see above</a>).</p>
	<p>It is noteworthy that Jude points out that these apostates arrived in the midst of these Believers by having &quot;crept in unnoticed.&quot; In other words, they seemed to be doctrinally compatible coming in, but turned out, instead, to be men who were &quot;marked out for condemnation.&quot; <strong>Remember this: Every false doctrine has just enough truth associated with it to make it appealing.</strong> It is vitally important that Believers look at every aspect of the basic teachings of any teacher before they embrace his teaching.</p>
<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">5 &para; But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. <br>
		    6 And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day; <br>
		    7 as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. <br>
	      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><b>Jude points out in verses 5-7 that those who defy sound doctrine are condemned as were:</b></p>
		<ul>
          <li>The non-believing Israelites coming out of Egypt			
          <li>The fallen angels<br>
            Perhaps a reference to <a title="Revelation 12 Summary" href="12-19.html#History" target="_blank">Revelation 12:4 (see notes)</a><br>
            Perhaps a reference to <a title="Genesis 6 Summary" href="1-3.html#Who" target="_blank">Genesis 6:1-2 (see notes)</a>
          <li>The twin cities - Sodom and Gomorrah.<br>
            A reference to <a title="Genesis 19 Summary" href="1-24.html#Neighbors" target="_blank">Genesis 19 (see notes)</a>
    </ul>
		<p>These examples serve to drive home the danger of judgment facing those who do likewise.                </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">8 &para; Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries. <br>
		    9 Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation, but said, &ldquo;The Lord rebuke you!&rdquo; <br>
		    10 But these speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves. <br>
		    11 Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, have run greedily in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished in the rebellion of Korah. <br>
		    12 &para; These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots; <br>
		    13 raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever. <br>
	      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Verse 8 further identifies the wicked deeds of these apostates. <b>Jude makes it clear in verse 8 that our responsibility is to shun apostasy and the apostates while turning the battle over to God himself. </b>However, in verses 10-13 we see that the Believers to whom Jude is writing were apparently tolerant of these apostates to the extent that they enjoyed full fellowship with them. Notice that specifically in verse 12, &quot;...when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear.&quot;</p>
	<p><a name="9"></a>Jude's statement of verse 9 regarding Michael and the body of Moses cannot be found elsewhere in scripture. Some scholars have concluded that Jude is citing a Jewish apocryphal pseudepigraphical work referred to as &quot;The Assumption of Moses&quot; aka &quot;The Testament of Moses.&quot; The only extant copy of that manuscript dates to the sixth century A.D. and is written in Latin. It may or may not be a translation of a manuscript that existed in Jude's day in Greek or Hebrew. However, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Jude was compelled to reference an incident that involved a dispute between Michael and Satan regarding the body of Moses. In doing so, Jude may or may not have been referencing an extant document at the time of his writing. Nonetheless, Jude's inclusion of this incident is enough evidence for us to conclude that there was, indeed, a dispute.</p>
		<p>In verse 11 three men get dishonorable mention, Cain (<a href="3-23.html#Democracy" title="Numbers 16 Summary" target="_blank">Numbers 16, see notes</a>). All three men epitomize rebellion against God. Hospitality toward those who blatantly rebel against God in the name of God is not acceptable, according to Jude here in verses 12-13. These are notoriously unregenerate men who falsely presented themselves as having a relationship with God.</p>
		<p>The &quot;love feasts&quot; (verse 12) were communal meals in which the early church apparently ate together and observed the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. The fact that these false teachers were not forbidden from dining with the brethren on such occasions is listed here as an indictment against the leadership of the church there. The vivid metaphorical description of the spiritual status of these men in verses 12-13 can leave little doubt that these are unregenerate men for whom are &quot;reserved the blackness of darkness forever.&quot; Hmmmm...sounds like eternal damnation to me...definitely unregenerate men. Further evidence of their spiritual state is seen in the verses that follow.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">14 &para; Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, <br>
		    15 to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.&rdquo; <br>
		    16 &para; These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and they mouth great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage. <br>
		    17 But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: <br>
		    18 how they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts. <br>
		    19 These are sensual persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit. <br>
		    20 &para; But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, <br>
		    21 keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. <br>
		    22 &para; And on some have compassion, making a distinction; <br>
		    23 but others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh. <br>
		    24 	Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling,<br>
And to present you faultless<br>
Before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, <br>
25 	To God our Savior,<br>
Who alone is wise,<br>
Be glory and majesty,<br>
Dominion and power,<br>
Both now and forever.<br>
Amen. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><a name="14"></a>Verse 14 has caused some controversy among Bible teachers as well. Jude seems to quote from the Book of Enoch here. The event accurately describes the return of Christ in <a title="Revelatin 19 Summary" href="11-5.html#False" title="Titus 1 Summary" target="_blank">Titus 1:12 (see notes)</a> Paul quotes favorably from Epimenides, a Cretan poet and philosopher from the sixth century B.C. who was widely believed to be a religious prophet. From this, we should deduct two truths: (1) Just because it is not part of the canon doesn't make it not so. (2) Just because a book is quoted in the scripture, doesn't mean it should be included in the canon of scripture.</p>
<p><b>So...Jude...what do you really think about these false teachers?</b> Answer, verse 16: &quot;These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and they mouth great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage.&quot; Verses 17-19 identify these men as &quot;mockers&quot; and as those who &quot;walk according to their own ungodly lusts.&quot; Moreover, and here's the clincher, verse 19 says of them regarding their relationship with God, &quot;having not the Spirit.&quot; <a href="8-21.html#Mission" title="Romans 10 Summary" target="_blank">Romans 10:17 (see notes)</a> says, &quot;So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&quot; Many will reject the truth, but some may receive Christ.</p>
	<p>Here's the simple message of Jude: <b>NO TOLERANCE FOR APOSTATES!</b> So much for showing an appreciation for diversity when it comes to religion. But what about their influence over Believers? Verse 24 is our security verse, &quot;<font size="3">Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, And to present you faultless Before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy.&quot;</font> My salvation does not depend upon my abilities, but on those of Christ. He keeps me saved. He will safely deliver me to Heaven.</p>
