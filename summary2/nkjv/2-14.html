<p>Of the three accounts, Mark does not directly mention the healing miracle that brought about this discussion as do Matthew and Luke. As a matter of fact, Mark begins his account by mentioning the crowd-control problem that existed - so much so, they were not even able to sit down for a meal. Mark reports in verse 21 that Jesus' friends went out to pull Jesus from the crowd. It is not clear from the text who said &quot;He is beside himself,&quot; the phrase used in the KJV...translated &quot;He is out of His mind&quot; in the NKJV. It is actually not clear what is meant by that phrase. That phrase comes from the Greek verb &quot;existemi,&quot; which can refer to actions reflecting insanity, or it can mean to be astonished or amazed. If it was the reckless crowd witnessing the casting out of demons (verse 22) who made the statement, the conversation of demon possession that follows would indicate that they might have tried to portray Jesus as insane. If, on the other hand, it was Jesus' friends who made the statement, they could have been using the term in the context that Jesus was overwhelmed by the crowd.</p>
<p><font size="3">Jesus casts out a demon and the people are amazed. Not the Jewish leaders though - they remain unimpressed and even <b>accuse Jesus of casting out demons by calling upon the chief demon (Beelzebub, derived from <a title="II Kings 1 Summary" href="9-1.html#Ahaziah" target="_blank">II Kings 1:2, see notes</a>), Satan himself.</b> Jesus shows the fallacy of such an outrageous accusation, but did they go too far this time with their verbal attacks on Jesus? </font><font size="3"><b>Yes, they did go too far! </b></font>Impugning Jesus (which the Jewish leaders habitually did) was one thing, but <b>to see the demonstration of the power of the Holy Spirit manifested through Jesus and call it the work of Satan went way over the line.</b> We see this sin clearly identified in Mark 3:30 &quot;because they said, 'He has an unclean spirit.'&quot; </p>
<p>It is vital that we understand what brought on this condemnation. <b>Specifically, they rejected the deity of Jesus and ascribed his source of power to Satan himself.</b> You simply don't get a stronger rejection of Jesus as Savior than that. I'm convinced that <b>this situation is unique in that these leaders viewed face to face the manifestations of the Spirit through Jesus, and yet accused him of being motivated by Satan.</b> I make that point because of the misuse of this passage by many today. Specifically, some have incorrectly been told that they cannot be saved because of having blasphemed the Holy Spirit in their past i.e. laughing at those who spoke in tongues or otherwise proclaimed themselves to be demonstrating the manifestation of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. <b>THIS IS AN OUTRAGEOUS ASSERTION!</b> Again, let me say that this scenario cannot be duplicated in this age; no one is prevented from being saved because of such an act. <a title="I Corinthians 12 Summary" href="9-6.html#Gifts" target="_blank">Click here to get a fuller understanding of the manifestation of spiritual gifts from the notes on I Corinthians 12.</a></p>
		<p>Matthew gives more coverage to this incident than do Mark and Luke. Notice particularly Matthew 12:32, &quot;Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.&quot; Matthew uses the Greek word &quot;aion&quot; (&quot;age&quot;) to describe the longevity of the condemnation - neither in this age, nor the age to come. That age to come is the kingdom the Jews have been anticipating, the Messianic age. Jesus makes reference to this Kingdom age in Matthew 12:28 and Luke 11:20 by proclaiming that if his actions are of God, then that Messianic age &quot;has come upon you.&quot; </p>
	<p><font size="3">Immediately following the outrageous claim by the Jewish leaders that Jesus was motivated by Satan, Jesus explains the principle of fruit bearing as applied to ministers of God. I can't resist mentioning <a title="Galatians 5 Summary" href="9-30.html#Key" target="_blank">Galatians 5:22-23 (see notes)</a> here, &quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.&quot; <b>When the source is God, the fruit is good.</b> </font></p>

    <p>These Pharisees and scribes ask for a sign that Jesus is who they think he claims to be. Jesus cites <a title="Jonah Summary" href="6-22.html#Darkness" target="_blank">John 19:31 (see notes)</a> tells us that this was not the regular weekly Sabbath they were trying to beat, but rather the beginning of a special &quot;high day,&quot; the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (treated like a weekly Sabbath). So, here's the sequence for the week in which Jesus was crucified. <b>Thursday was Passover when Jesus was crucified. Friday was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Saturday was the regular Sabbath day. On Sunday morning Jesus resurrected after three days AND three nights.</b> But there's another fascination with this passage. <b>Where was Jesus for those three days?</b> He prophesies in this passage that he'll be in the &quot;heart of the earth.&quot; For a complete scriptural analysis of the location of Jesus for these three days, read the information in the box on the right side of this screen entitled, &quot;<a title="Article: Paradise Relocated" href="http://www.bibletrack.com/notes/resource/misc/Paradise.html" target="_blank">Paradise Relocated</a>.&quot;</p>
	<p>Jesus also cites the inquiring mind of the Queen of Sheba when she visited Solomon in <a title="II Kings 10 Summary" href="8-18.html#Sheba" target="_blank">I Kings 10:1-13; II Chronicles 9:1-12 (see notes)</a> as an example of what happens when people really desire to know God. Jesus uses these two Old Testament examples to make the point that these had embraced the manifestation of God's salvation, while the current generation is rejecting  it.</p>

		<p>Jesus is still addressing these Jewish leaders who made the outrageous accusation against him in Matthew 12:31-32 (<a href="#Jewish">see above</a>). Here's the lesson:<b> If you don't fill your spiritual void with God's Spirit, you may be disappointed with your next tenant. </b></p>
	<p><b>People often ask me if I think a Believer can be possessed by a demon.</b> My answer is, &quot;NO!&quot; It flies in the face of New Testament consistency to believe that a Believer can be indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God at salvation (<a title="I Corinthians 12 Summary" href="8-17.html#Lives" target="_blank">Romans 8:9, see notes</a>), and at the same time, be indwelt by a demon. As a matter of fact, is that not what Jesus is saying here in this passage? He implies that a demon sets up housekeeping in a vessel which is spiritually devoid, not the scenario that exists in a Believer who is indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</p>

	<p>When Mary and Mary's other sons, the brothers of Jesus, come to where Jesus is speaking, <b>he uses this occasion to introduce the concept of the Body of Christ.</b> We refer to the Body of Christ as the church, a reference to all of those who have trusted Jesus Christ as their savior by faith. Jesus makes the point here that his relatives, as God in the flesh, Savior of the world and Messiah, are not limited to those are are kin by physical ancestry, but extends to all of those who accept him by faith.</p>
