</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <br />
2 &ldquo;Consecrate to Me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and beast; it is Mine.&rdquo; <br />
3 &para; And Moses said to the people: &ldquo;Remember this day in which you went out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out of this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten. <br />
4 On this day you are going out, in the month Abib. <br />
5 And it shall be, when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month. <br />
6 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD. <br />
7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days. And no leavened bread shall be seen among you, nor shall leaven be seen among you in all your quarters. <br />
8 And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, &ldquo;This is done because of what the LORD did for me when I came up from Egypt.&rsquo; <br />
9 It shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the LORD&rsquo;S law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt. <br />
10 You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year. <br />
11 &para; &ldquo;And it shall be, when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you, <br />
12 that you shall set apart to the LORD all that open the womb, that is, every firstborn that comes from an animal which you have; the males shall be the LORD&rsquo;S. <br />
13 But every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. And all the firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem. <br />
14 So it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, &ldquo;What is this?&rsquo; that you shall say to him, &lsquo;By strength of hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. <br />
15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all males that open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.&rsquo; <br />
16 It shall be as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.&rdquo; <br />

<p><font size="4"><b><img src="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/image/The_exodus.jpg" alt="The Route of the Exodus" height="468" width="406" align="right" border="1"></b></font><font size="3">Now you may think that the number one interest is to put some distance between the Hebrews and Egypt. That's not as important as <b>establishing some ground rules for worship.</b> So, after leaving Egypt, but before crossing the Red Sea, <b>God establishes some principles</b> of service to God. <b>Two issues here: proper observance of the Feast of Unleavened Bread and the consecration of the firstborn.</b> When you're in a hurry, there's no time for the bread to rise. The Hebrews would commemorate this exodus occasion throughout their history by eating unleavened bread for seven days immediately following the Passover Meal. <a title="BibleTrack: Passover Day" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Passover_day.html" target="_blank">See the difference between the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread by clicking here.</a></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Notice verses 9 and 16 in this passage regarding the purpose of eating unleavened bread:</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="3">Exodus 13:9 It shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the LORD&rsquo;S law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt.<br>
						Exodus 13:16 It shall be as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
	</blockquote>
		<p>Later, in <a title="Deuteronomy 6 Summary" href="4-6.html#Shema" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 6:5-9 (see notes)</a>, we see a similar reference to &quot;<font size="3">a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.&quot; Because of  Deuteronomy 6:8 the observant Jews down through the centuries to today have worn a leather wallet (called a Tefillin) on the arm and head that contain these prayers.</font></p>
	<p><b>The firstborn male from each Hebrew, human and animal, was to be consecrated before the Lord for service.</b> Later on in <a title="Numbers 3 Summary" href="2-23.html#Offense" target="_blank">Exodus 32:29 (see notes)</a>. At the exodus, this consecration gesture even affected the firstborn of their animals. These animals had to be sacrificed. Donkeys got a break; they're unclean; they had to have a sacrifice of a clean animal made in their place. According to verses 14-16, this consecration of the firstborn is to be a &quot;sign&quot; of the fact that God spared the firstborn of Israel while slaying the firstborn of the Egyptians. <b>All of these things were instituted to help Israel remember who they were and from whence they came.</b> One more thing about the firstborn - verse 2 indicates that we're talking about those who are first out of the womb, not the firstborn of the father.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, the month of Abib is the same as the month of Nisan, the first month of the Hebrew calendar year after the Exodus. &quot;Abib&quot; is actually a description of the month meaning, &quot;young ear of barley or other grain.&quot; That was the month their crops began to bloom and corresponds to our March/April. The Old Testament uses &quot;Abib&quot; before the Babylonian captivity and &quot;Nisan&quot; afterward. <a title="Jewish Feasts" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Feasts.html" target="_blank">For more information on the Hebrew calendar and festivals, click here.</a></p>

      </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">17 &para; Then it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, &ldquo;Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt.&rdquo; <br />
18 So God led the people around by way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up in orderly ranks out of the land of Egypt. <br />
19 &para; And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had placed the children of Israel under solemn oath, saying, &ldquo;God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here with you.&rdquo; <br />
20 &para; So they took their journey from Succoth and camped in Etham at the edge of the wilderness. <br />
		  </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Right up the coast of the Mediterranean Sea was a trade route that passed next to Canaan.</b> You will recall that their famous ancestor Joseph had been carried into Egyptian captivity by that same route (<a title="Genesis 41 Summary" href="4-28.html#Words" target="_blank">Joshua 24:32, see notes</a>). </font>	          </p>
	<p><font size="3">You will notice on the map (to the right) the point at which they probably crossed the Red Sea. Since that time the Red Sea has receded, and many maps today show only dry land at that point. </font><font size="3">Again, let me emphasize, God took them across the Red Sea and closed it behind them so that they could not return. The stay in the wilderness was planned by God for nation training - character building. Now, as for the length of the stay...that's different. Israel was in that wilderness for 40 years because they needed the extra training. That lengthening of time in the wilderness became necessary as a result of the rebellion in <a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="3-21.html#People" target="_blank">Numbers 14 (see notes)</a>.</font></p>
	<p><strong>But the real story is quite clear regarding why Israel went southeast instead of northeast.</strong> In actuality, they were not headed for Canaan at all - not yet. They are headed for Mount Horeb (aka Sinai) close to where Moses' father-in-law lived in Midian. That's the place where Moses saw the burning bush and heard God speak to him while he was watching Jethro's sheep. On that occasion, God had spoken to Moses in <a href="2-9.html#Bush" title="Exodus 3 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 3:12 (see notes)</a> and said, &quot;I will certainly be with you. And this shall be a sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, <strong>you shall serve God on this mountain.</strong>&quot; So, you see, it's not time to go to Canaan yet - need some Hebrew training first, and that training is to take place at Mount Horeb (aka Sinai) near Midian.</p>

		<p><font size="3">What's that <b>big column of vapor</b> in front of Israel? And look, it becomes <b>a column of fire at night!</b> That was the <b>Hebrew compass. </b>Just <b>follow the pillar.</b> As a matter of fact, the fiery pillar at night <b>served as headlights</b> for their journey. We commonly refer to this pillar as the &quot;Shekinah Glory.&quot; (Refer to the article to the right of this page for details or <a title="Shekinah Glory" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Shekinah_glory.html" target="_blank">click here to see it full screen</a>.) Let's take note of something: God is leading them on their journey by this pillar, and it led them south, farther away from Canaan. So, they are moving farther away from their eventual destination as they follow God's lead, but<b> they're not lost.</b> Call them whatever else you want, but <b>don't call them lost.</b> God is leading these Hebrews into a place where they can be prepared to be victorious when they reach Canaan; they are headed for Mount Horeb (aka Sinai) near Midian. This is a great lesson for Believers today regarding God's will. <b>Many times God has to train us before he can use us properly. </b>God's timetable is not necessarily compatible with our own timetable - just as with the Hebrews.

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2"><br />
1 Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying: <br />
2 &ldquo;Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and camp before Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal Zephon; you shall camp before it by the sea. <br />
3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, &ldquo;They are bewildered by the land; the wilderness has closed them in.&rsquo; <br />
4 Then I will harden Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, so that he will pursue them; and I will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD.&rdquo; And they did so. <br />
5 &para; Now it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people; and they said, &ldquo;Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?&rdquo; <br />
6 So he made ready his chariot and took his people with him. <br />
7 Also, he took six hundred choice chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt with captains over every one of them. <br />
8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with boldness. <br />
9 So the Egyptians pursued them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and overtook them camping by the sea beside Pi Hahiroth, before Baal Zephon. <br />
10 &para; And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the LORD. <br />
11 Then they said to Moses, &ldquo;Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you so dealt with us, to bring us up out of Egypt? <br />
12 Is this not the word that we told you in Egypt, saying, &ldquo;Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians&rsquo;? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.&rdquo; <br />
13 &para; And Moses said to the people, &ldquo;Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall see again no more forever. <br />
14 The LORD will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.&rdquo; <br />
15 &para; And the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Why do you cry to Me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward. <br />
16 But lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. And the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. <br />
17 And I indeed will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. So I will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen. <br />
18 Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gained honor for Myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.&rdquo; <br />
19 &para; And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud went from before them and stood behind them. <br />
20 So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus it was a cloud and darkness to the one, and it gave light by night to the other, so that the one did not come near the other all that night. <br />
21 &para; Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea into dry land, and the waters were divided. <br />
22 So the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. <br />
23 And the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh&rsquo;s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. <br />
24 &para; Now it came to pass, in the morning watch, that the LORD looked down upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and He troubled the army of the Egyptians. <br />
25 And He took off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, &ldquo;Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.&rdquo; <br />
26 &para; Then the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.&rdquo; <br />
27 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when the morning appeared, the sea returned to its full depth, while the Egyptians were fleeing into it. So the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. <br />
28 Then the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. Not so much as one of them remained. <br />
29 But the children of Israel had walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. <br />
30 &para; So the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. <br />
31 Thus Israel saw the great work which the LORD had done in Egypt; so the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD and His servant Moses. <br />

<p><font size="3">The Hebrews still need a Pharaoh-type lesson on God's ability to provide. Here it is in verse 4, &quot;...Then<b> I will harden Pharaoh&#146;s heart</b>...&quot; Oh, no! Not again! Hasn't he had enough? According to verses 3-5, Pharaoh is probably thinking, &quot;Silly Hebrews! Look at them already hemmed in by the wilderness and the sea!&quot; Here he comes in hot pursuit followed by 600 chariots. <b>This man means business. </b>No big deal for the Hebrews, though, right? Look at verse 10, &quot;...So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the LORD.&quot; <b>After all the miracles that had served to win their release, they're still afraid? Say it ain't so!</b> Just look at verses 11-12 where the Hebrews turn loose on Moses and say, in essence, <b>&quot;Look what you've gotten us into!&quot;</b> They've already forgotten how miserable they were in Egypt. Now it's all Moses' fault. Then a miracle - the pillar (aka Shekinah Glory) moves from before them to behind them and posts between the armies of Pharaoh and the Hebrews. Moses tells them that this is the last time they'll see Egyptians. <b>But wait! There's more!</b> <b>The Red Sea parts</b><b> that night </b>(using the rod of Moses as an instrument)<b> providing dry land across.</b> That's right; no boots needed here; the land is dry. <b>Across the sea bed the Hebrews go.</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Egyptians? That's a different story. First of all, verse 19 tells us that the pillar of cloud/fire (Hebrew compass...and more) blocked the way between the Egyptians and the Hebrews to prevent their pursuit until after all of the Israelites had passed over the Red Sea. Then, as the Egyptians pursue the Hebrews across the dry Red Sea, their chariot wheels fall off (verse 25) and the sea closes in on them at the command of Moses; <b>they all die.</b> Why did this happen? Look at verse 31, &quot;Thus <strong>Israel saw the great work which the LORD had done in Egypt</strong>; so the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD and His servant Moses.&quot; <b>It was just another of God's ways of showing the Hebrews his ability to deliver. It also served as a demonstration (verse 16) that God was using Moses as his instrument of leadership.</b></font></p>

            19 &para; For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them. But the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. <br />
            20 &para; Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. <br />
            21 And Miriam answered them:<br />
&ldquo;Sing to the LORD,<br />
            For He has triumphed gloriously!<br />
            The horse and its rider<br />
            He has thrown into the sea!&rdquo; <br />

	<p><font size="3">Sometimes you just gotta sing. That's right...everyone breaks out in song. Miriam (the sister of Moses and Aaron), with other women chime in to sing about God's provision. You know how country-music songs tell a story? Well, this is one of those story songs. We actually don't know who authored the song.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Notice verse 15, &quot;Then the chiefs of <strong>Edom</strong> will be dismayed; The mighty men of <strong>Moab</strong>, Trembling will take hold of them; All the inhabitants of <strong>Canaan</strong> will melt away.&quot; According to the lyrics, they obviously don't think they are lost (going in the wrong direction...yeah, but not lost). Notice the mention of their destination (Philistia) along with the route they will take to get there (through Edom and then Moab). The song seems to reflect an anticipated journey to Mount Horeb (aka Sinai), then across the Jordan River, and then northward along the east side of the Jordan River before crossing back over the Jordan into Canaan. </font></p>
	<p>It is worth noting here that this route to Canaan (the one depicted in the song) is the same route they followed in <a href="2-8.html#Funeral" title="Genesis 50 Summary" target="_blank">Genesis 50 (see notes)</a> when Joseph took Jacob back to Canaan for burial. That route is about 75 miles farther than the direct route up the coast. <font size="3">By the way, that's the route they would eventually take back to Canaan...40 years later.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">22 &para; So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea; then they went out into the Wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness and found no water. <br />
23 Now when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah. <br />
24 And the people complained against Moses, saying, &ldquo;What shall we drink?&rdquo; <br />
25 So he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a tree. When he cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. &para; There He made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there He tested them, <br />
26 and said, &ldquo;If you diligently heed the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians. For I am the LORD who heals you.&rdquo; <br />
27 &para; Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there by the waters. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Moses, we have a crisis! The people are thirsty and the water is nasty tasting.</b> These folks have seen some incredible miracles surrounding their release from Egypt. They'll take this little water-supply problem in stride, right? Wrong! Look at Exodus 15:24, &quot;And the people complained against Moses, saying, 'What shall we drink?'&quot; <b>Do you really think this rag-tag bunch of rebellious Hebrews are ready to conquer Canaan?</b> Well, God provides miraculously using his servant Moses, and Moses marks this occasion in verse 25 with &quot;a statute and an ordinance.&quot; That's a nice guarantee in verse 26, &quot;and said, 'If you diligently heed the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians. For I am the LORD who heals you.'&quot; Simple enough?</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Incidentally, this crisis takes place at Marah. We find that this event isn't forgotten and is undoubtedly remembered as one of the top ten rebellions of Israel in <a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="3-21.html#God" target="_blank">Numbers 14:22 (see notes)</a>.</font></p>
