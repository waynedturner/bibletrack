    <p><strong>In this passage, we see the following events in Jesus' ministry:</strong></p>
<ul>
          <li>The sermon introducing the Kingdom of Heaven</li>
          <li>It was preached between the second and third Passover Feasts of Jesus' ministry.</li>
          <li>Jesus is likely somewhere in Galilee during this period of time.</li>
        </ul>
<p><font size="4"><b>What you must know before you read this passage<br>
		  </b></font><font size="4" color="#ee0000"><b>All about the Kingdom message<br>
	      </b></font><font size="3">Many people misunderstand aspects of this sermon by Jesus because they don't place it in the proper context. <b>The context is vital.</b> First of all, <b>Jesus came as the Messiah to establish the kingdom on earth prophesied by the Old Testament prophets.</b> Of course it had been <b>prophesied</b> by Daniel and Isaiah that<b> the Jews would reject the initial offer</b>, but nonetheless, the offer had to be made to fulfill Old Testament prophecy. <b>If the Jews had accepted Jesus as their Messiah, the Davidic throne would have been restored at the first advent of Jesus, the Messiah.</b> </font></p>
	<p><font size="3">That brings us to the second major contextual consideration for this passage, the religious leadership. <b>The priestly families were the Sadducees; they denied two major scriptural doctrines, the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body.</b> That doesn't leave much. What makes that even more ironic is the fact that <b>they controlled the priesthood</b> - claimed to be the descendants of David's high priest, Zadok. Then there were the <b>Pharisees</b>. They believed in the supernatural all right, and <b>they believed in all of the Old Testament.</b> Their problem was that <b>they had become an elite class of picky, picky religionists.</b> Over the years they had handed down extra-scriptural traditions which they orally appended to the Law of Moses, having given these oral traditions and laws the same weight as the written Mosaic law. These oral traditions were later (early third century A.D.) compiled into written form, a volume of books known as the Mishnah.<b> </b><b>They flaunted their law-keeping practices in the faces of everyone else.</b> In their eyes, nobody was as righteous as they were. If they were, they would be Pharisees too. Of course there were the Herodians, but we don't find much written about them. They were more like Sadducees, but their zeal for the ruling family of Herods was their distinction. </font><a href="5-9.html#Politicians" title="Matthew 22 Summary" target="_blank">For more on these three political parties, click here.</a></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>So, meet your religious leaders!</b></font><b> They were corrupt before God. That's why John the Baptist addressed them as a &quot;brood of vipers&quot;</b> (<a title="Matthew 3; Luke 3 Summary" href="1-22.html#Seed" target="_blank">Genesis 15:6 (see notes)</a> says of Abraham, &quot;And he believed in the LORD, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.&quot; <b>Spiritual righteousness has never been attained by keeping the law, but the Pharisees had manipulated it to make it appear that way. For all effective purposes, the Pharisees and Sadducees had established a false religion.</b></p>
	<p><a name="New"></a><b>So, what was the kingdom on earth to look like?</b> <b>Let's look at what is known as the &quot;New Covenant&quot; of </b><a title="Jeremiah 31 Summary" href="10-30.html#Covenant" target="_blank"><b>Jeremiah 31:31-34</b> (see notes)</a><b>:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>31 Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah&mdash;<br>
		    32 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, though I was a husband to them, says the LORD.  <br>
	        33 But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.  <br>
	        34 No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, &quot;Know the LORD,&quot; for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>What about the Messiah who was prophesied in the Old Testament? Look at </b><a title="Jeremiah 23 Summary" href="10-27.html#Leadership" target="_blank"><b>Jeremiah 23:5</b> (see notes)</a><b>:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>&quot;Behold, the days are coming,&quot; says the LORD, 	&quot;That I will raise to David a Branch of righteousness; 	A King shall reign and prosper, 	And execute judgment and righteousness in the earth.&quot;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>More about the Messiah was prophesied in </b><a title="Isaiah 9 Summary" href="9-16.html#Messiah" target="_blank"><b>Isaiah 9:6-7</b> (see notes)</a><b>:</b></p>
<blockquote>
			<p>6 For unto us a Child is born, 	Unto us a Son is given; 	And the government will be upon His shoulder. 	And His name will be called 	Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, 	Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  <br>
			  7 
		    Of the increase of His government and peace 	There will be no end, 	Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, 	To order it and establish it with judgment and justice 	From that time forward, even forever. 	The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>Based upon these Old Testament prophecies, what will the Kingdom of God/Heaven look like?</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Headed up by the Messiah, the descendant of David and ruler over the earth (Jeremiah 23:5)
			<li>The Messiah will control the world-wide government (Isaiah 9:6-7).
			<li>The Messiah will be God manifested bodily on the earth (Isaiah 9:6-7).
			<li>The Law of God will be ingrained inwardly within people rather than compliance to a written law (Jeremiah 31:31-34).<br>This is, in fact, the way Believers today are controlled by the Holy Spirit.			<li>Everyone will be saved (Jeremiah 31:31-34).
		</ul>
		<p><b>So, let's recap the circumstances in Israel</b> when Jesus began ministering. <b>Jesus is the Messiah.</b> <b>The religious system over the Jews was corrupt.</b> This corrupt influence over the Jewish masses caused them to reject Jesus as Messiah. The Old Testament prophecies detailing the Messiah's suffering were at hand. However, <b>the Jews were offered the Kingdom of God/Heaven</b><b>; they could have accepted it, but they rejected instead.</b> This sermon (aka &quot;Sermon on the Mount&quot;) characterizes the difference between vain religion and true righteousness. <b>The Sadducees and Pharisees practiced vain religion, but they also controlled the religious practice of the Jewish masses.</b> <b>This sermon highlights their hypocrisy and their inconsistencies.</b> This sermon lists the qualities of true righteousness - kingdom-appropriate righteousness.<b> This kingdom being offered is the kingdom on earth prophesied by the Old Testament prophets with the characteristics listed above.</b></p>

		<p>First of all, let's establish that both of these accounts record the same occasion of Jesus preaching. At first notice, the Matthew designation  &quot;he went up on a mountain&quot; would seem to be different from Luke's &quot;stood on a level place.&quot; Actually, the Greek phrase in Luke's account specifically records a &quot;topos&quot; (place) with the adjective modifier of &quot;pedinos&quot; which means &quot;level to the feet.&quot; In other words, while on the mountain, Jesus chose a spot level enough for the people to stand and listen. </p>
	<p><b>In order to properly understand these verses, please read the section above regarding the &quot;Kingdom message.&quot; Both Matthew and Luke are giving an account of the same sermon given by Jesus. </b>People today commonly refer to the &quot;Blessed&quot; verses contained in these chapters as &quot;The Beatitudes.&quot; The word &quot;beatitude&quot; means &quot;supreme blessedness.&quot; Notice that Luke's list is considerably scaled down as compared to Matthew's list. <font size="3"><b>Many people think way too hard when they read these &quot;beatitudes.&quot; </b>Think of these as kingdom equivalents to the &quot;fruit of the Spirit&quot; found in <a title="Galatians 5 Summary" href="9-30.html#Key" target="_blank">Galatians 5:22-23 (see notes)</a>. <b>Together, they form a view of the characteristics of those who are kingdom-appropriate people.</b> Do not use these as stand-alone action/result items. In other words, being &quot;meek,&quot; by itself, does not result in inheriting the earth (i.e. entering the Davidic kingdom). However,<b> people with a heart relationship with God are led by God to exhibit the characteristics found in Matthew 5:2-10 and Luke 6:20-26.</b> </font>Consider this: Luke's abbreviated account of this message as compared to Matthew validates the fact that one should understand that these verses address general attitudes about godliness rather than specifics. As I said, sometimes people think waaaay too hard on these so-called &quot;beatitudes.&quot;</p>
		<p><font size="3">Now notice something; <b>these attributes of kingdom-appropriate people fly in the face of the lifestyles of the Sadducees and Pharisees.</b> As a matter of fact, <b>these leaders were all about &quot;doing.&quot; They would have scoffed at the very idea that God is more pleased with the attitudes reflected in verses 2-10 rather than their &quot;doings.&quot;</b> I'm certain that this passage was written as a <b>stark contrast between fake righteousness and true righteousness.</b> True righteousness is a heart relationship with God, not a compliance checklist, as had been practiced by their contemporary Jewish leaders. In other words, in this passage, <b>let us observe all the things that the Sadducees and Pharisees are not. </b></font>However, when a Believer is led by the Holy Spirit, the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) is manifested in his life (love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance). Therefore, <b>a life directed by the Holy Spirit captures the qualities of what we know here as &quot;the beatitudes.&quot;</b></p>
	<p><b>Jesus takes a subtle shot at the hypocrisy of the Jewish leadership</b> in verses 11-12. <b>Persecution is inevitable</b>, just like the persecution experienced by the Old Testament prophets. Question: <b>Who persecuted the Old Testament prophets?</b> Answer: The Jewish leadership. And who were Jesus' persecutors and critics? You guessed it - the Jewish leadership.</p>

		<p>They are told that true Believers do strive to be examples; they are &quot;the light of the world.&quot; Moreover, they add the missing component of &quot;salt&quot; to the world. Literally, the &quot;light&quot; of the Messianic Kingdom and the flavor (&quot;salt&quot;) will be manifested through those who have an honest and sincere relationship with God...in contrast to the Pharisees who simply comply with the Law of Moses. Then Jesus explains the role of the Mosaic Law. <b>His declaration in verses 17-18 brings into view the &quot;new covenant&quot; </b>(<a href="10-30.html#Covenant" target="_blank"><b>Jeremiah 31:31-34</b> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> <b>That new covenant cannot take force until the requirements of the law are fulfilled. This passage is a prophecy of Christ's necessary death on the cross to fulfill the sacrificial requirements of the law.</b></p>
	<p>Many remove verses 17-18 out of their context and promote a doctrine that erroneously requires Gentile Believers to keep the Mosaic Law as a condition of continued salvation in Jesus Christ. THAT'S WRONG! Look closely at what Jesus is saying here, &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law <b>till all is fulfilled.</b>&quot; Here's an important concept, but let me emphasize it by asking a question first: <b>Did Jesus fulfill the law when he died on the cross?</b> If your answer is &quot;no,&quot; then tell me what Paul meant when he said in <a title="Colossians 2 Summary" href="10-16.html#Christ" target="_blank">Colossians 2:14 (see notes)</a>. <b>A correct perspective on the Believer's relationship to the Law of Moses is vital for a complete understanding of the Kingdom message preached by Christ during his earthly ministry.</b></p>

		<p><b>These comments, introduced in verses 19-20 </b>(<a href="#Declaration">see above</a>)<b>, are intended to serve as an indictment against the legalism of the Pharisees. They practiced actions while ignoring the condition of the heart. To them, it was all about doing.</b> These verses accentuate the sinful conditions of their hearts and show that, <b>while they appear to keep the law, in reality, they fall miserably short in heart and attitude.</b> He lists these examples. Read this passage, and you will see that <b>the Pharisees were, in actuality, way guilty of violating the spirit of the Law.</b></p>
	<p><b>The examples that Jesus lists in verses 21 to 37 are designed to emphasize the failure of the Pharisees to actually keep the Law in verse 20. </b>Keep in mind: The Pharisees were all about outward compliance. To them righteousness was compliance and had nothing to do with attitude. Jesus emphasizes that outward compliance falls short as a standard for righteousness because of the wicked motivations of one's heart and mind. <b>It is ironic that Jesus means to use these verses to expose the hypocrisy of the falling-way-short Pharisees, but many misdirected Believers today use these verses to add a new layer to the Mosaic Law for their fellow Believers to keep.</b> Here's the bottom line on Matthew 5:21-37, and it's found in <a title="Romans 3:23 Summary" href="8-13.html#Jews" target="_blank">Romans 3:23 (see notes)</a>, &quot;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&quot; Jesus means to expose the wickedness of the human heart and thus emphasize the need for authentic righteousness. When we pick through the list of sins found in these verses, identify and promote abstinence from them as an enhancement to personal righteousness, I'm afraid we miss the point Jesus was making to these hypocritical Pharisees about the nature of sin.</p>
	<p><b>With that in mind, let's look at those concepts of sin dealt with by Jesus here:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Anger with another without cause is akin to murder (verses 21-25).
			<li>To have sexual thoughts about a woman who is not one's wife is akin to adultery (verses 27-30).
			<li>The common Pharisaical practice of divorce and remarriage is akin to adultery (verse 31-32).<br>

				<a title="Leviticus 27 Summary" href="3-12.html#Vows" target="_blank">Click here to see the notes on Leviticus 27 concerning vows/oaths.</a>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Jesus seems to be listing common abuses of the Law of Moses by the Pharisees themselves in these verses...and their shortcomings. In other words, they were all about doing and the appearance of compliance, but with corrupt hearts before God.</b></p>

		<p><font size="3">Here's another interesting characteristic of the Sadducees and Pharisees: they were all about vengeance. Jesus introduces this section with a reference to the Old Testament Laws regarding punishment for bodily harm when he says in verse 38, &quot;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'&quot; He, of course, is making reference to <a href="4-12.html#Witnesses" title="Deuteronomy 19 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 19:21 (see notes)</a>. </font>These Sadducees and Pharisees practiced vengeance to an extreme. &quot;Longsuffering&quot; wasn't even in their vocabulary! They were all about getting even. They overlooked the compassion components in the Law of Moses, but jumped on the punitive. Jesus mentions a few examples of the compassion found throughout the Law of Moses in verses 39-42.</p>
	<p><font size="3">T</font><font size="3">he Sadducees and Pharisees continually sought to murder Jesus. It wasn't just Jesus; they seemed to take joy in persecuting those who, in their opinion, fell short in keeping their rendition of the law. Notice verse 43, &quot;You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'&quot; The first part is based upon <a href="3-8.html#Laws" title="Leviticus 19 Summary" target="_blank">Leviticus 19:17-18 (see notes)</a>. Of course there is nothing in the Law of Moses nor rabbinical literature that endorses hating one's enemies. I suppose the Sadducees and Pharisees had inserted that as part of their oral tradition. However, there is no question that these Jewish leaders had a hatred toward what they considered Roman oppression...and what do you call the attitude that resulted in the crucifixion of Jesus. Here's the reality: they felt completely justified in hating that which did not forward their cause. What's more, they had a disdain for the &quot;little people,&quot; so to speak - those who did not practice their brand of Judaism to the same extent as they did. As you read through the Gospel accounts which record the confrontations with Jesus by these Pharisees, you see Jesus pointing out their enormous hypocrisy. Their love for others outside their own circle of influential Jewish leaders was virtually non existent.</font></p>
	<p>Jesus introduces a new concept not found in the Law of Moses, per se, in verse 44 when he says, &quot;<font size="3">But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you.&quot;</font> Jesus is, as was stated previously, introducing true spirituality to a group of people who had only been beaten over the head with &quot;doing&quot; and &quot;vengeance.&quot;</p>

  <p>Well, it's obvious that <b>everything Jesus has taught so far flies in the face of the practice of  Sadducees and Pharisees, </b>but he's not done. These hypocrites do their <b>charitable deeds</b> only when it enhances their reputation. They want<b> to be seen</b> and praised for their actions. Notice verse 2;<b> they do it &quot;that they may have glory from men.&quot;</b></p>
  <p>And then there's the issue of <b>public prayer.</b> <b>Who are those guys that periodically during the day stop what they're doing and begin chanting repetitive phrases out loud in the presence of everyone. Why...they're Pharisees!</b> That's one of their badges of honor. <b>That's their way of elevating themselves above the rest of the Jewish populace.</b> That's their way of saying, <b>&quot;We're holier than any of you!&quot;</b> Jesus says, here's the deal on prayer: <b>Real prayer is done in private, and it isn't comprised of a series of recitations.</b> Real prayer is communication from our hearts to God's. Jesus insists,<b> &quot;Don't recite phrases as a substitute for prayer.&quot;</b> Now here's the ironic part. <b>Jesus gives an example of a prayer with meaningful components in verses 9-13.</b> He's demonstrating prayer that is from the heart and meaningful - not one of reciting memorized phrases. <b>And so what do people today do with this model prayer? They memorize and recite it (aka &quot;The Lord's Prayer&quot;) as a substitute for real, heart-felt prayer.</b> Admit it; that is ironic, isn't it? Incidentally, the prayer we pray in public before a meal is for the purpose of identifying ourselves with Christ as our Savior, not for the purpose of lording ourselves over others as the Pharisees did. <b>It's a heart thing, you see.</b> By the way, Jesus also proposes this prayer model much later in <a href="3-30.html#Prayer" title="Luke 11 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 11:2-4 (see notes)</a>.</p>
  <p>There's a carefully chosen term in verse 7, &quot;heathen&quot; (Greek: ethnikos). That word usually refers to pagan Gentiles. It is interesting, though, that Jesus refers to prayer &quot;in the synagogues&quot; in verse 5 as he refers to the practice of the Pharisees. It would appear that Jesus intends for these hypocritical Pharisees to be likened to heathen Gentiles when they do their repetitious prayers.</p>
  <p><b>What about forgiveness (verses 14-15)?</b> We'll see as we read through the Gospels that <b>the Pharisees were not known as big-time forgivers.</b> Forgiveness of the weaknesses of others would only serve to diminish the importance in their minds of their extreme pursuit for righteous-looking reputations.</p>
		<p><b>How about fasting (verses 16-18)?</b> In the Old Testament the Jews only fasted on the Day of Atonement (<a title="Leviticus 16 Summary" href="10-9.html#Fasting" target="_blank">For a complete overview concerning fasting, click here to read the notes on Isaiah 58.</a></p>

		<p>Verses 19 to 34 drive home a spiritual concept foreign to the Sadducees and Pharisees: <b>It's not about show; it's about pleasing God. They were all show. </b>In that process of show, their treasures were being laid up on earth rather than Heaven. In verses 22-23, it is the eye that provides the light for one's body. Blind eyes provide one with only darkness. Obviously the metaphor here refers to spiritual light as opposed to spiritual darkness or authentic righteousness compared to fabricated righteousness - just like the corrupt religious leaders practiced. <b>You must choose one or the other (verse 24).</b> Is your master to be the praise of others or the praise of God? Jesus encourages his audience to demonstrate a true relationship with God that ignores haughty appearances and lays up treasure in heaven (verses 19-21 and verse 33). <b>This message flies in the face of Pharisaical practice.</b></p>
		<p>In the remaining verses here Jesus encourages a life of dependence on God. The point is this: We don't really have control over the events of our lives anyway; only God does. Therefore, being in sync with God is key to a life of righteousness and joy. The rest? Well...it's covered in verse 33, &quot;<font size="3">But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.&quot;</font> When one's first priority is pleasing God, all the right stuff follows.</p>
