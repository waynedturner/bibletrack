				  <p><font size="3">The first vessel specified to be placed into the new house of God is to be the Ark of the Covenant. The Hebrew word here for &quot;ark&quot; is </font><font size="3">altogether different from the word used for Noah's big ol' boat. The Hebrew word for Noah's &quot;ark&quot; is &quot;tay-baw&acute;&quot; which is also used in Exodus 2:3,5 to describe the little basket that Moses was floating in when discovered by Pharaoh's daughter. <b>The Hebrew word used here for the &quot;Ark&quot; of the Covenant is &quot;aw-rone&acute;.&quot; It means &quot;box.&quot;</b> So while the words are identical to us in English, they were not to the Hebrews. You'll notice from verse 16 that<b> this box will contain the tablets</b> that will be given to Moses with the Law inscribed upon them. You'll also notice how elaborately made it is. This 2.25 ft. by 2.25 ft. by 3.75 ft. box is the<b> most sacred vessel in Israel's history.</b> Notice that there was a specific way in which it was to be carried - poles that slipped through rings on the side. That will become significant later on in Israel's history when they engineer their own design for transporting it in <a title="II Samuel 6 Summary" href="6-15.html#Ark" target="_blank">II Samuel 6 (see notes)</a>, a flawed attempt that ends in death.<br>

2 You shall make its horns on its four corners; its horns shall be of one piece with it. And you shall overlay it with bronze. <br />
3 Also you shall make its pans to receive its ashes, and its shovels and its basins and its forks and its firepans; you shall make all its utensils of bronze. <br />
4 You shall make a grate for it, a network of bronze; and on the network you shall make four bronze rings at its four corners. <br />
5 You shall put it under the rim of the altar beneath, that the network may be midway up the altar. <br />
6 And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze. <br />
7 The poles shall be put in the rings, and the poles shall be on the two sides of the altar to bear it. <br />
8 You shall make it hollow with boards; as it was shown you on the mountain, so shall they make it.<br />

Notice how large it is: Exodus 27:1, &quot;You shall make an altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide&mdash;the altar shall be square&mdash;and its height shall be three cubits.&quot;<b> That's big - 7.5 feet square and 4.5 feet high.</b> Of course, it will be positioned outside in the courtyard. That's where the animal sacrifices will take place. <b>You'll see in verse 4 that Moses had his own &quot;network.&quot;</b></font> Actually, that's the grate that goes on the top of the altar. Oh, and you'll also notice that this will be carried by poles through rings as well.<br>
