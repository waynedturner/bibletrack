23 and begged Him earnestly, saying, &ldquo;My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.&rdquo; <br />
24 So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him. <br />
25 &para; Now a certain woman had a flow of blood for twelve years, <br />
26 and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse. <br />
27 When she heard about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment. <br />
28 For she said, &ldquo;If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.&rdquo; <br />
29 &para; Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction. <br />
30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, &ldquo;Who touched My clothes?&rdquo;<br />
31 &para; But His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;You see the multitude thronging You, and You say, &lsquo;Who touched Me?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;<br />
32 &para; And He looked around to see her who had done this thing. <br />
33 But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. <br />
34 And He said to her, &ldquo;Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.&rdquo;<br />
35 &para; While He was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue&rsquo;s house who said, &ldquo;Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?&rdquo; <br />
36 &para; As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; only believe.&rdquo;<br />
37 And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. <br />
38 Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who wept and wailed loudly. <br />
39 When He came in, He said to them, &ldquo;Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping.&rdquo;<br />
40 &para; And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with Him, and entered where the child was lying. <br />
41 Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, &ldquo;Talitha, cumi,&rdquo; which is translated, &ldquo;Little girl, I say to you, arise.&rdquo;<br />
42 Immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years of age. And they were overcome with great amazement. <br />
43 But He commanded them strictly that no one should know it, and said that something should be given her to eat. </font></td>
    <td align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#cce1ff"><font size="2">40 &para; So it was, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him. <br />

42 for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she was dying. &para; But as He went, the multitudes thronged Him. <br />
43 Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any, <br />
44 came from behind and touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped. <br />
45 &para; And Jesus said, &ldquo;Who touched Me?&rdquo; &para; When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, &ldquo;Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say, &lsquo;Who touched Me?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;<br />
46 &para; But Jesus said, &ldquo;Somebody touched Me, for I perceived power going out from Me.&rdquo;<br />
47 Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately. <br />
48 &para; And He said to her, &ldquo;Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you well. Go in peace.&rdquo;<br />
49 &para; While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue&rsquo;s house, saying to him, &ldquo;Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Teacher.&rdquo; <br />

<p><font size="3">You will recall from <a title="Matthew 8 Summary" href="3-10.html#Touch" target="_blank">Matthew 14:34-36 (see notes)</a>. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">When Jesus stops and asks the people who touched him, the woman having done so was afraid to speak up at first, but then steps forward. Now we see an interesting lesson on faith. Jesus points out that this woman's faith was remarkable and noteworthy inasmuch as <b>she recognized the power of Jesus to heal and committed her well being to him.</b> Mark and Luke point out that the woman had spent all of her money on physicians, but to no avail. Incidentally, why do all three accounts contain this story within a story? It seems likely that the fact that Jesus arrives at the home of Jairus seemingly too late is the reason the Gospel writers wanted to show why Jesus was delayed in his arrival. It is interesting, if not really significant, that Matthew and Luke specifically address the fact that she touched the hem/border (Greek: &quot;kraspedon&quot; i.e. Hebrew: &quot;tzitzit&quot;) while Mark only reports that she touched the garment of Jesus.</font></p>
<p>Upon arrival at the home of Jairus, you will notice that Mark and Luke point out that only James, John and Peter actually go into the home. Though only Matthew (of the three Gospel writers) was with Jesus that day (<a title="Introduction to Gospels" href="1-1.html#Top" target="_blank">see &quot;An Introduction to The Gospels&quot;</a>), he did not actually enter into the house - perhaps the reason he noticed the &quot;flute players&quot; outside. Both Mark and Luke received their information later on from those eyewitnesses and go into greater detail; their accounts are more lengthy than Matthew's. Jesus is told that he is too late; the synagogue ruler's twelve-year-old daughter is dead. Jesus tells them that she is just sleeping, a comment that gets a deriding laugh from the folks who have been her attendants. <b>Jesus goes in, commands her to arise, and she does. </b><b>Remarkable! So, was she dead or not? </b>Everyone thought she was, but in all three Gospel accounts, Jesus says that she was not.<b> </b>However, Luke, the doctor, gives a little more detail in Luke 8:55 when he says, &quot;Then <strong>her spirit returned</strong>, and she arose immediately.&quot; The Greek word used by Luke for &quot;spirit&quot; is &quot;pneuma&quot; which was also the common Greek word for &quot;breath&quot; or &quot;wind.&quot; In other words, Luke's account seems to indicate that the people around her had observed her cessation of breathing previous to the healing. Well...no wonder they thought she was dead! You will notice that only Mark actually quotes the Aramaic phrase used by Jesus in this resurrection, and Mark has the most exhaustive account. Ironically, even though Mark and Luke tell us that Jesus charged the parents to keep this miracle to themselves, Matthew says in verse 26, &quot;And the report of this went out into all that land.&quot; Some things are just too good not to tell.</p>
	<p>We see in this story the reason why it is important to consider all three accounts of the synoptic writers when studying a passage concerning events during the earthly ministry of Jesus. Matthew just gives the high points of the incident, using just nine verses to tell the whole story. As a matter of fact, from his account you don't realize that the twelve-year-old girl actually dies while Jesus is en route to her home, nor does Matthew name her father, Jairus. Mark and Luke fill in those details. Matthew also omits the drama that surrounded the woman of faith who touched Jesus' garment. Only Mark tells us that Jesus actually spoke to the girl in Aramaic prior to her resurrection. Incidentally, this takes place in Northern Israel, well removed from the hostile environment around Jerusalem.</p>

		<p><font size="3">There's something about the healing of the two blind men here that makes it stand out. You will notice that <b>these two blind men acknowledge that Jesus is the Messiah</b> when they refer to him in verse 27 as the &quot;Son of David.&quot; Jesus heals them privately and charges in verse 30 to keep this incident to themselves, which we see they did not; they told everybody. I'm just guessing here, but I think it was probably the fact that they addressed Jesus as the Messiah that prompted Jesus to tell them not to make public notice of their healing. He knew that his time for the sacrifice of himself had not yet come, and a proclamation by two blind men that they had been healed by the Messiah would undoubtedly bring jealous Jewish leaders prematurely gunning for him.</font></p>

<p>When Jesus then casts the devil out of the dumb man, and he begins to speak, the Pharisees accuse Jesus of doing so through the power of Satan himself. Now this sounds familiar. The same Pharisaical talking points are used in <a title="Matthew 12, Mark 3, Luke 11 Summary" href="2-14.html#Jewish" target="_blank">Matthew 12:22-37/Mark 3:20-30/Luke 11:14-23 (see notes)</a>. While not much is said about this incident in this passage, on that previous occasion, Jesus proclaims a severe consequence to those who made such an assertion. On that similar occasion, we see that such comments reflected attitudes toward Jesus for which the Pharisees would never find forgiveness.</p>

</table>
<p>This short passage is packed with implications. First of all, notice how intolerant Jesus' home town was of his ministry. They immediately point out that he's not royalty, but rather a construction-worker's son. It's not common to name the mother with regard to a son's heritage, but they say, &quot;Is  this not the carpenter,<b> the son of Mary.&quot;</b> To them, it was outrageous for Jesus to be considered anything other than a common laborer with non-royalty brothers and sisters. It further says of these hometown folks, &quot;So they were offended...&quot; The Greek word for &quot;offended&quot; is &quot;skandalizo&quot; from which we get our word &quot;scandalize.&quot; <b>They literally considered it scandalous for Jesus to receive any kind of honor whatsoever.</b> Jesus simply takes it all in stride as he replies, &quot;A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.&quot;</p>
<p>Notice how Matthew sums it up in verse 58, &quot;Now He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.&quot; That's a little different from Mark's characterization in verse 5, &quot;And He marveled because of their unbelief. Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.&quot; Both acknowledge that Jesus did perform some miracles in his home town. Matthew seems to put it into perspective when he points out that <b>Jesus did not do more because of their refusal to believe</b>, no matter what they saw. So, it wasn't that he couldn't, but rather that he limited himself because of their unbelief.</p>
	<p>One might conclude from Matthew 13:57 and Mark 6:4 that Jesus' own family lacked respect for his ministry. The text doesn't actually say that, so I don't think it's appropriate to assume that this was the case.</p>
