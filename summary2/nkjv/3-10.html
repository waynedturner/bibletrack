<p>This event follows the feeding of the five thousand recorded in <a href="3-6.html#Feeding" title="John 6 Summary" target="_blank">John 6:4 (see notes)</a> that the third Passover of Jesus' ministry was taking place. Now we find Jesus sending his disciples away, back toward Capernaum/Bethsaida (see map). Since they reach Gennesaret in Matthew 14:34/Mark 6:53 (<a href="#Touch">see below</a>), they are traveling along the shore from east to west.</p>
<p><font size="3">It is interesting that, while Matthew, Mark and John give the account of the story of Jesus walking on the water, <b>only Matthew tells us about Peter trying to duplicate the feat.</b> </font><font size="3">Obviously that wasn't the big story to John and Mark. John gives a great bit of detail to the subsequent fallout on the day following this miracle where we see that many of Jesus' disciples (not the twelve Apostles) cease following Jesus.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">They are<b> rowing against the wind</b> (about 3 to 3.5 miles out) and making little or no progress across the Sea of Galilee toward Capernaum/Bethsaida when Jesus (who had stayed behind to pray) walks by the ship...on the water. Matthew and Mark point out that the disciples thought at first that Jesus was a &quot;spirit&quot; (i.e. &quot;ghost&quot;). The Greek word used in Matthew 14:26 and Mark 6:49 is &quot;phantasma&quot; and is used only these two times in the New Testament. After everything they had seen Jesus do, why would a little Jesus water walking surprise them so? And why would it be easier to believe that they were seeing a ghost rather than Jesus actually walking on the water? Mark makes a noteworthy observation in Mark 6:52, &quot;For they had not understood about the loaves, because their heart was hardened.&quot; The term &quot;heart was hardened&quot; is only meant to convey to the reader that these disciples were having a difficult time equating the miracles of Jesus with the reality that he, as God, had power over the elements of the universe. <b>Even though they had viewed the reality-defying feat of feeding the five thousand, they were nonetheless amazed at a little bit of water walking.</b> Mark seems to find that aspect of the story amusing while Matthew finds amusing the fact that Peter tries his hand out at water walking as well. John gives the account, but makes a point that neither Matthew nor Mark mention in John 6:15 regarding Jesus' initial absence from the ship, &quot;Therefore when Jesus perceived that <strong>they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king</strong>, He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.&quot; Only John felt that it was important to show <strong>WHY</strong> Jesus initially stayed back after sending the people away.</font></p>

<p><strong>This episode takes place in the synagogue in Capernaum (verse 59) near the time of the Passover feast - one year before the crucifixion.</strong> Jesus had just miraculously fed the <font size="3">5,000 (<a title="Matthew 14:14-21; Mark 6:33-44; Luke 9:11-17; John 6:1-14 Summary" href="3-6.html#Feeding" target="_blank">Matthew 14:14-21; Mark 6:33-44; Luke 9:11-17; John 6:1-14, see notes</a>). </font>The teaching session becomes one of extreme doctrinal significance. The discussion turns to one of motivation when the people finally find Jesus. He points out to the crowd in verse 26, &quot;...you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.&quot; That's an interesting observation Jesus shares with us: <b>Many of these followers were simply prosperity seekers.</b> They weren't interested in Jesus for any of the right reasons; they simply observed that he was able to take two fishes and five loaves and feed 5,000 with food left over. <b>Incidentally, this prosperity message is still being preached today.</b> <b>Many are following a message of  financial wealth and well being as their primary attraction to Jesus.</b> You will note that Jesus clearly establishes that this is not the proper motivation for following him.</p>
<p><b>&quot;Well, how about a sign then?&quot; the people asked.</b> You know...something akin to the manna God dropped from Heaven back in the wilderness wanderings. I'm reminded here of Paul's characterization of the Jews in <font size="3"><a title="I Corinthians 1 Summary" href="9-18.html#Motivation" target="_blank">II Corinthians 5:17 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.&quot; <b>I'd say that's a pretty significant renovation, wouldn't you?</b></p>
	<p><b>What's the differentiation here?</b> Here it is. <b>Salvation is not merely experiencing an enlightenment or saying some special words out loud.</b> <b>It's not just a determination to do right or a deep emotional experience of remorse. </b>All of these may accompany salvation, but <b>true salvation happens when God supernaturally, through the power of the Holy Spirit, draws a person to commit themselves completely to Jesus Christ as their ONLY means to God and Heaven.</b> When that process takes place,<b> it's permanent.</b> It says so right here in verse 35, &quot;shall never hunger&quot; and verse 37, &quot;I will by no means cast out&quot; and in verse 39, &quot;I should lose nothing&quot; and in verse 40, &quot;have everlasting life.&quot; Incidentally, verse 37 includes a Greek double negative (&quot;ou me&quot;). That double-negative combination adds strength to the adamant guarantee, &quot;by no means cast out.&quot; It's the equivalent of our oft-used slang term &quot;ain't no way!&quot; This phrase is actually used 94 times in the New Testament. </p>
	<p>Here's a very strong and decisive statement to the discussion in John 6:47, &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, <b>he who believes in Me has everlasting life.</b>&quot; So, how long is everlasting anyway? Until you sin? No! Everlasting is everlasting. <b>Salvation is a relationship - not a passing experience!</b> <b>When you trust Christ as your Savior, you enter into a permanent, eternal covenant with God whereby you are baptized by the Holy Spirit into the Body of Christ </b>(<a title="I Corinthians 12 Summary" href="9-6.html#Analogy" target="_blank">I Corinthians 12:13, see notes</a>). You become part of God's family. <b>Our shortcomings have no bearing on the integrity of that permanent relationship. </b></p>
	<p>Jesus is very clear in verses 34-35 with his metaphor for eating: He's clearly talking about believing on Jesus as Savior. In other words, <b>Bread of life = everlasting life.</b> Notice Jesus' reference in verse 45 to the New Covenant (<a title="Jeremiah 31 Summary" href="10-30.html#Covenant" target="_blank">Jeremiah 31:31-34, click here</a>), &quot;It is written in the prophets, 'And they shall all be taught by God.' Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.&quot; Jesus refers to the fact that the future Kingdom on Earth that will be established will see a New Covenant established whereby all inhabitants of the earth are saved and living by faith. This concept is in stark contrast to the practice among the Jews in Jesus' day.</p>
	<p>Then Jesus caps off the discussion in John 6:58, &quot;This is the bread which came down from heaven&mdash;not as your fathers ate the manna, and are dead. He who eats this bread will live forever.&quot; Manna is the supernatural bread that was supplied from God for forty years to Israel beginning in <a href="9-6.html#Ordinance" target="_blank">I Corinthians 11:23-26 (see notes)</a>.</p>

65 And He said, &ldquo;Therefore I have said to you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted to him by My Father.&rdquo;<br />
66 &para; From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more. <br />
67 Then Jesus said to the twelve, &ldquo;Do you also want to go away?&rdquo;<br />
68 &para; But Simon Peter answered Him, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. <br />
69 Also we have come to believe and know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; <br />
70 &para; Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?&rdquo;<br />
71 He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who would betray Him, being one of the twelve. </font></td>

		<p>After this discussion, some of the seekers who had been following Jesus followed no more as we see in John 6:66, &quot;From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more.&quot; <b> That statement has no implications regarding salvation whatsoever.</b> It's a simple statement regarding who continued to physically follow Jesus around in his ministry. However, what about the Twelve? Here's Peter's defining statement in John 6:68-69, &quot;But Simon Peter answered Him, 'Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.  Also we have come to believe and know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.'&quot; However, that was not the testimony of one there. Look at verse 70, &quot;Jesus answered them, 'Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?'&quot; The Greek word for &quot;devil&quot; there is &quot;diabolos,&quot; from which we get our English word, &quot;diabolical.&quot; That word is usually translated &quot;devil,&quot; but is also sometimes translated &quot;accuser&quot; or &quot;slanderer.&quot; Since the definite article is not used here (i.e. <b>the</b> devil), it is not likely that Jesus is referring to Judas as the devil incarnate, but rather is identifying that one there (Judas) has motivations that are diabolical - the devil will be pleased; Jesus identifies that one one of them is there with evil motivations. <b>This puts to rest the notion that Judas<i> fell out </i>of a relationship with Jesus or<i> lost </i>his salvation.</b> Jesus clearly identifies that<b> Judas was chosen</b> as a disciple for a specific purpose, but was <b>evil from the beginning.</b> </p>
	<p>Let me say again: <b>Salvation and discipleship are two different relationships.</b> Would you not agree that verse 70 tells us that while<b> Judas WAS a disciple, he WAS NOT saved. </b>Let's not stop with Judas. Are there not a host of people in our world today who subscribe to the notion of emulating the life of Jesus, but who have not trusted Jesus Christ as their personal Savior? There are entire religions and denominations based upon this principle. Therefore, let me say it even once again: <b>Salvation and discipleship are two different relationships. The victorious Believer has both.</b> <a title="Matthew 16:24-27; Mark 8:34-38; Luke 9:23-26 Summary" href="3-18.html#Discipleship" target="_blank">If you want to read more about the difference between salvation and discipleship, click here to read the notes on Matthew 16:24-27; Mark 8:34-38; Luke 9:23-26.</a></p>
