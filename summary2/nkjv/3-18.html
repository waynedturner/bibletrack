<p>Jesus, as he talks with his disciples after the incident with the religionists in the preceding verses, compares them to leaven in the following context: Leaven (yeast) grows until everything it contacts is affected by the <b>leaven</b>. Likewise, these religious leaders had spread their corrupt doctrine to the point that it had permeated the thinking of the Jewish people. It is interesting that Matthew recalls specifically that Jesus mentioned the Sadducees in the same context with the Pharisees, but Mark mentions Herod. Certainly Jesus lumps all three into the same religious-but-lost category. <b>By the time Jesus would be crucified, the leaven (corruption) of the Sadducees, Pharisees and Herod would develop into an angry mob ready to crucify the Messiah. </b>If you thought, as many do, that &quot;All religions are good if you are sincere,&quot; this encounter between Jesus and these very religious men should cause you to reassess your position.</p>
<p>These verses make it apparent that the disciples had a tough time transitioning between physical and spiritual applications. Jesus perceived that they thought perhaps Jesus' remarks had something to do with the fact that they were hungry and had a food shortage - thus the reference to the two miraculous multi-thousand feedings on a shoe-string budget. Jesus clarifies that the growing-leaven analogy speaks to the spreading corruptness of these God-rejecting religionists.</p>

		<p>Bethsaida is located on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee in Northern Israel. Jesus demonstrates his power over blindness. Only Mark records this particular healing. There are a couple of interesting aspects to this account: First of all, Jesus met the man in Bethsaida, but led him out of town to perform the healing. Subsequently, he told him not to go back into town, but to return to his own home. Since a vital aspect of Jesus' earthly ministry was to be fulfilled in his crucifixion on Passover Day after a three-plus year ministry, Jesus took measures along the way to control the hype (so to speak) over miracles such as this one. Secondly, it is interesting that, after Jesus' first action in the process of healing the man, the man sees, but not clearly. However, part two of the healing process restores the man's eyesight completely. Many over the years have conjectured as to why Jesus healed this man in two phases, but Mark simply doesn't elaborate. There is simply no way of knowing from scripture why the healing was performed in this fashion.</p>

<p>Jesus and his disciples are in northern Israel around Caesarea Phillipi, about 25 miles north of the Sea of Galilee. It's a simple question that Jesus asks, <b>&quot;Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?&quot;</b> Matthew gives this occasion twice as much attention as Mark or Luke. When Jesus gets an assortment of answers from the disciples, he follows up with another question,<b> &quot;But who do you say that I am?&quot; Peter wastes no time with his reply, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot;</b> That's all that Mark and Luke report of the occasion. At that time, Jesus made some significant observations about Peter's confession which are reported only by Matthew. Keep in mind, of the three writers, Matthew is the only one who was a first-hand witness of this dialogue (<a href="1-1.html" title="Matthew 1 Summary" target="_blank">see &quot;Introduction to the Gospels</a>).</p>
<p><b>Notice what Jesus says about Peter's insight and future role as a result of his insightful reply in Matthew 16:17-19: </b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Peter received this revelation from God.
			<li>Jesus will build his church upon this revelatory word.
			<li>The gates of Hell shall not prevail against this church.
			<li>Peter will receive &quot;keys&quot; which will enable him to &quot;bind&quot; and &quot;loose.&quot;
		</ul>
		<p><b>So, what is this that Christ has promised Peter.</b> It is impossible to say with absolute certainty, but it would appear that Peter's actions in the Book of Acts were empowered as a result of this declaration by Jesus. <b>Specifically, when the Jews received the Word along with the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost</b> (<a title="Acts 2 Summary" href="7-16.html#Peter" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a><b>, likewise, received the Word along with the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit, who also moderated that event? If you said Peter in answer to all three questions, you are correct.</b> It appears that on all three occasions Peter was exercising the &quot;keys&quot; which had been presented to him in this passage of scripture. As a result, three separate categories of people, Jews, Samaritans and Gentiles (that's everybody) were formally inducted into the newly-founded church, the Body of Christ. <b>Those are some pretty powerful keys, wouldn't you say? There can be no question; Peter was set apart for special service on this occasion.</b></p>
		<p><b>Some have suggested that Jesus was speaking collectively to all of the disciples when he made these statements. </b>In other words, they claim that Jesus was designating apostolic authority here. However, the Greek wording is very clear here. While in English usage &quot;you&quot; or &quot;thee&quot; can be used as either a singular or plural second person pronoun, not so in Greek. <b>All references in verses 17-19 using the second person personal pronoun are singular and refer only to Peter and Peter alone.</b> The same is the case with the person and number of the Greek verbs used in those verses. Therefore, this was not a general commissioning to all of the disciples, but comments directed only to Peter, distinct from other general commissioning statements elsewhere directed to all of the Apostles. That much is certain.</p>
		<p>Incidentally, for those who might wonder, this conversation between Jesus and his disciples obviously took place in Greek, not Aramaic or Hebrew. The special play on words between the Greek name assigned to Peter (&quot;petros&quot;) and its similarity to the Greek word for &quot;rock&quot; (&quot;petra&quot;) is key in Matthew 16:18, &quot;...you are Peter, and on this <strong>rock</strong> I will build My church.&quot; The differentiation of this sentence would have made no sense spoken in Aramaic or Hebrew. The &quot;rock&quot; (Greek: &quot;petra&quot;) is not Peter himself, but rather the revelation given by Peter in verse 16, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; However, it should be noted that Peter's Greek name (&quot;Petros&quot;) is a translation from the equivalent Aramaic word for &quot;rock&quot; as is seen in John 1:42 when Jesus says to him, &quot;Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.&quot; However, the difference between the proper masculine Greek name (&quot;Petros&quot;) and the feminine word for rock (&quot;petra&quot;) is only a relational play on words in the Greek language. If such a play on words had been spoken between Jesus and Peter in Aramaic, Matthew surely would have given us the Aramaic equivalents in this passage.</p>

		<p>Peter obviously did not understand the whole plan at this point. He was good with the ministry aspect of Jesus, but could not comprehend the necessity of the crucifixion being presented here by Jesus. Of course Jesus understood his role as the prophesied suffering Messiah (<a title="Isaiah 52-53 Summary" href="10-7.html#Salvation" target="_blank">Isaiah 52-53, see notes</a>) from the beginning, but you might imagine that such a concept would be difficult for his disciples to digest. If we see nothing else in this passage, <b>we get the full impact of this necessity for crucifixion in Jesus' harsh reply to Peter, &quot;Get behind me, Satan...&quot;</b> What did Jesus mean by that? Was Peter Satan? <b>NO!</b> A strong point is being made here by Jesus. <b>Satan would have liked nothing better than for Jesus to take a pass on crucifixion.</b> <b>Redemption for all mankind would have been foiled.</b> That crucifixion is the key to salvation for the ages. To suggest that Jesus skip his primary purpose for coming, the crucifixion, is to play into the hands of Satanic thinking. So, in the strongest words possible, <b>Jesus rebukes Peter for such a suggestion, but Peter was not, nor would he ever be, Satan.</b> Interestingly, Luke does not record the actual rebuke of Peter by Jesus on this occasion.</p>

	<p>Jesus has just completed his comments regarding what lies ahead of them - the mock trials, the crucifixion, the resurrection. Peter's reaction (<a href="#Satan">in the preceding section</a>) indicated that he did not anticipate that it would be going in this direction. Now it's time to clearly indicate the cost of discipleship that lies in their future. Here's an important concept for understanding the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels. <b>Salvation is different from discipleship.</b> As a matter of fact, let's add a category called &quot;special-purpose discipleship.&quot; Let's do some definitions here:</p>
<ul>
			<li><b>Salvation</b> - Trusting Jesus Christ by faith as your only means for eternal life and going to Heaven. It's a &quot;born-again&quot; experience facilitated by the empowering of the Holy Spirit by faith that delivers the Believer into God's family. An eternity-long covenant relationship is experienced between the Believer and God as a result. <a title="What the Bible says about Eternal Life" href="3-10.html#Watch" target="_blank">John 6:70, see notes</a>).		<li><b>Special-purpose discipleship</b> - The action of dropping everything one is doing, forsaking family ties and possessions and exclusively committing everything (all your resources) to the cause of ministering with Jesus in his earthly ministry.
		</ul>
		<p><b>Whoa! What is this third category, &quot;Special-purpose discipleship?&quot; </b>Simply speaking, Jesus, on several occasions in the Gospels, called men to recognize the urgency of his earthly mission and drop everything (I mean everything) to follow and assist in this ministry. For example, I married while in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam era. For nine months I reported to my squadron each day and in the evening went home to my wife. <b>Then I received my orders to the Western Pacific - NO WIVES ALLOWED.</b> Even though I ultimately ended up serving in a squadron in Iwakuni, Japan, <b>all of us who served in the Western Pacific were required to leave our wives  and families behind and exclusively give our attention to the crisis at hand.</b> So, does being a Marine mean forsaking family? Not necessarily. There were special-purpose assignments that did, but other assignments did not. Please understand this analogy. As Jesus neared his crucifixion, he sought disciples who would recognize this urgency, drop everything else they were involved in (including family) and follow him.<b> I reject the notion that discipleship today involves turning one's back on family commitments.</b> Context is important here. This special-purpose discipleship is to be distinguished from expectations of discipleship for the New Testament Believer. The Apostle Paul makes clear throughout his writings the importance of commitment to one's family responsibilities.</p>
		<p><b>Since Jesus has just elaborated on the perilous events that will take place from this point forward leading up to the crucifixion, this is definitely a call to extreme, &quot;special purpose&quot; discipleship.</b></p>

		<p>After this call to discipleship in the preceding verses,<b> it would appear that Jesus is telling his disciples that they are going to witness the establishment of the Kingdom of God/Heaven</b> which Jesus had been talking about since his earthly ministry began. He seems to indicate it will happen before they die. In reality, the Kingdom of God/Heaven still has not come, and it will not until a distinct, yet-future time. So one naturally wonders what this statement means in Matthew 16:28, &quot;Assuredly, I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.&quot; It is logical to conclude that Jesus must have been referring to the transfiguration which takes place in the following verses (six days later) in all three synoptic accounts (<font size="3">Matthew 17:1-9; Mark 9:2-10; Luke 9:28-36</font> - <a href="#Transfiguration">see below</a>). In fact, <b>these disciples did see Jesus in the presence of Elijah and Moses on that occasion.</b></p>
	<p>There is certainly a wide array of thinking regarding the meaning of this verse. <b>The central consideration here is this: What is the &quot;kingdom of God?&quot;</b> Until Israel declared its independence as a nation in 1948 after 2,500+ years of not being an sovereign nation, many theologians promoted what is today frequently called &quot;replacement theology.&quot; Simply stated, they believed that all of the literal promises to Israel for the future would be fulfilled in the Body of Christ, the church. To them, it simply wasn't realistic to believe, after a period of over 2,500 years, that Israel would once again become a nation. <b>As such, they saw the New Testament church as the replacement entity in nearly every Old Testament prophecy regarding Israel.</b> Incidentally, many of these commentators provided some excellent technical commentaries as well as popular commentaries that are still widely used as references today. How many copies of Matthew Henry's commentary are sitting on bookshelves around the world at this moment? However, <b>since the 1948 birth of Israel, most commentators today interpret prophecies regarding Israel literally rather than figuratively.</b> That being the case, we must clearly define what is meant when Jesus refers to the &quot;kingdom of God.&quot; To the &quot;replacement theologian&quot; (they aren't so plentiful anymore), the &quot;kingdom of God&quot; refers to the birth of the church. However, this provides many, many problems of interpretation regarding Israel-specific comments Jesus made regarding the &quot;kingdom&quot; all through the gospel accounts. I am certain that when Jesus refers to the &quot;kingdom of God/kingdom of Heaven,&quot; he is literally speaking of the time when Jesus will rule the earth as the Messiah. That was the reality the Jews of his day were looking for, and that is the reality he addressed.<b> I'm not comfortable with making Jesus' term &quot;kingdom of God/Heaven&quot; a moving target. I'm convinced that Jesus meant it to be understood literally each time he used the term.</b></p>
		<p>That being said, I'm uneasy with calling the ascension of Jesus in <a title="Acts 1 Summary" href="7-4.html#Resurrection" target="_blank">Acts 1 (see notes)</a> the fulfillment of this prophecy. That is a &quot;replacement theology&quot; notion that equates the New Testament church to be the equivalent of Israel with regard to prophecy. Likewise, some replacement theologians turned preterists in their view of prophecy see the fulfillment of this prophecy in the destruction of the temple. In order to make that premise work, they insist that the Apostle John's writing of his Revelation took place before the destruction of the temple in 70 A.D. Most scholars today date the writing of Revelation somewhere around 95 A.D. The preterist sees the kingdom of God established in the form of New Testament Believers and further believes that most, if not all, of the events in the Book of Revelation were fulfilled leading up to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple. Therefore, dismissing the short-sighted theories that Israel is the church and the church is Israel, the literalist is left with the task of explaining how these disciples could have seen the &quot;coming&quot; of the &quot;kingdom of God&quot; before they died. <b>While not completely satisfying to the inquiring mind, the occurrence of the transfiguration of Jesus six days later in the presence of Moses and Elijah may have very well served to fulfill this prophecy</b> (<a href="#Transfiguration">see below</a>)<b>.</b></p>
