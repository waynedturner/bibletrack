  <p><font size="2">5 &para; Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying: <br />
6 &ldquo;Take the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse them ceremonially.<br />
7 Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purification on them, and let them shave all their body, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean. <br />
8 Then let them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering. <br />
9 And you shall bring the Levites before the tabernacle of meeting, and you shall gather together the whole congregation of the children of Israel. <br />
10 So you shall bring the Levites before the LORD, and the children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites; <br />
11 and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD like a wave offering from the children of Israel, that they may perform the work of the LORD. <br />
12 Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls, and you shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites. <br />
13 &para; &ldquo;And you shall stand the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and then offer them like a wave offering to the LORD. <br />
14 Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine. <br />
15 After that the Levites shall go in to service the tabernacle of meeting. So you shall cleanse them and offer them like a wave offering. <br />
16 For they are wholly given to Me from among the children of Israel; I have taken them for Myself instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the children of Israel. <br />
17 For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are Mine, both man and beast; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them to Myself. <br />
18 I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the children of Israel. <br />
19 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the work for the children of Israel in the tabernacle of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel when the children of Israel come near the sanctuary.&rdquo; <br />
20 &para; Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel did to the Levites; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them. <br />
21 And the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes; then Aaron presented them like a wave offering before the LORD, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them. <br />
22 After that the Levites went in to do their work in the tabernacle of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them. <br />
23 &para; Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <br />
24 &ldquo;This is what pertains to the Levites: From twenty-five years old and above one may enter to perform service in the work of the tabernacle of meeting; <br />
25 and at the age of fifty years they must cease performing this work, and shall work no more. <br />
26 They may minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of meeting, to attend to needs, but they themselves shall do no work. Thus you shall do to the Levites regarding their duties.&rdquo;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it's time to consecrate the Levites. The first step was to get ceremonially sprinkled and then <b>shave them all over</b>. Yes, I said all over (verse 7). Verse 8 specifies the offerings to be made on behalf of these Levites at their consecration ceremony. Then we have a component of the ceremony still used today for consecration into Christian ministry, <b>the laying on of hands. </b>The whole congregation of Israel did so (verse 9). That's a lot of hand laying. Then the Levites lay their hands on the sacrifices to make atonement for themselves (verse 12). These Levites were consecrated to the Lord instead of the firstborn of all the Tribes (<a title="Numbers 3 Summary" href="7-13.html#Levites" target="_blank">I Chronicles 23:24-25, see notes</a>). In that passage it is expressly stated that he did so because the Levites no longer had to carry the dwelling and its furniture. This remained the standard.</p>
<p>We find the consecration service for the priests (Aaron and his sons) in <a title="Leviticus 8 Summary" href="3-3.html#Aaron" target="_blank">Leviticus 8 (see notes)</a>. Remember, not all Levites were priests - only Aaron's descendants. It is interesting to note that <strong>the priests were sprinkled with blood, but the Levites with water. </strong></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">1 Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying: <br />
2 &ldquo;Let the children of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time. <br />
3 On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time. According to all its rites and ceremonies you shall keep it.&rdquo; <br />
4 So Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover. <br />
5 And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, at twilight, in the Wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did. <br />
6 &para; Now there were certain men who were defiled by a human corpse, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron that day. <br />
7 And those men said to him, &ldquo;We became defiled by a human corpse. Why are we kept from presenting the offering of the LORD at its appointed time among the children of Israel?&rdquo; <br />
8 &para; And Moses said to them, &ldquo;Stand still, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.&rdquo; <br />
9 &para; Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <br />
10 &ldquo;Speak to the children of Israel, saying: &lsquo;If anyone of you or your posterity is unclean because of a corpse, or is far away on a journey, he may still keep the LORD&rsquo;S Passover. <br />
11 On the fourteenth day of the second month, at twilight, they may keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. <br />
12 They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break one of its bones. According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it. <br />
13 But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and ceases to keep the Passover, that same person shall be cut off from among his people, because he did not bring the offering of the LORD at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin. <br />
14 &para; &ldquo;And if a stranger dwells among you, and would keep the LORD&rsquo;S Passover, he must do so according to the rite of the Passover and according to its ceremony; you shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger and the native of the land.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />
          </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now we come to the first anniversary mark of leaving Egypt (verse 1), and it's time to observe Passover. <font size="3">If you live in the camp, you must keep the Passover on the designated day.That is so, unless you were defiled in some way or out of town; then you observed it after the complication was rectified on the fourteenth day of the following month. <a title="Passover" href="9-24.html#Close" title="II Chronicles 30 Summary" target="_blank">II Chronicles 30 (see notes)</a>.</p>
        <p><font size="3">Here's that phrase &quot;that same person shall be cut off from among his people&quot; for those who declined to observe this special feast of Israel. In other words, <b>you observed it (Jew or not) or they kicked you out of the camp</b> - no freedom of religion there.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">It is interesting that this passage also includes the non-Jewish &quot;stranger&quot; in the Passover observance (verse 14). However, there was a particular stipulation for the stranger in <a title="Exodus 12 Summary" href="2-13.html#Passover" target="_blank">Exodus 12:48 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And when a stranger dwells with you and wants to keep the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as a native of the land. For no uncircumcised person shall eat it.&quot; To which the stranger might reply, &quot;No thanks; I had a big meal before I left home.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>There's an interesting deduction that might be made regarding circumcision and Passover.</b> In the initial instructions given to the Hebrews regarding observance of Passover in <a title="Exodus 12 Summary" href="4-21.html#Circumcision" target="_blank"> Joshua 5:1-9 (see notes)</a>. In that passage Joshua is instructed to have a mass circumcision prior to entering Canaan. We are told in that passage that they did not circumcise for those 38 years of wilderness wandering. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that they did not observe Passover during that time either, because to do so would have been a violation of Exodus 12:48 along with these instructions in Numbers 9.</font></p>

	<p>The cloud over the Tabernacle was the sign of God's dwelling among them; it is known to Bible students as the Shekinah Glory. When it stayed put, they stayed put. When it moved, they moved. May I emphasize again, the <b>Israelites were never lost</b>; God's presence was among them and instructed them exactly where to go and when to go there.

3 When they blow both of them, all the congregation shall gather before you at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. <br />
4 But if they blow only one, then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel, shall gather to you. <br />
5 When you sound the advance, the camps that lie on the east side shall then begin their journey. <br />
6 When you sound the advance the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall begin their journey; they shall sound the call for them to begin their journeys. <br />
7 And when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but not sound the advance. <br />
8 The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and these shall be to you as an ordinance forever throughout your generations. <br />

  </blockquote>
<p>How do you signal some two million or so people? You do so with these two silver trumpets - different sound patterns for different events (war, meetings, moving, etc.). Only the priests blew the trumpets (verse 8). You can imagine that blowing those trumpets must have been a much-envied responsibility. They also used these trumpets to signal new months and special festival days. The calendar during that period of time was based upon observation and not calculation. The priests declared the appropriate time for these events with the blowing of the big ol' silver trumpets. <a title="Jewish Calendar" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Jewish_calendar.html" target="_blank">For more information on the observational calendar see the information box to the right or click here.</a></p>

<p>Since Israel had been encamped at Mount Sinai (aka Mount Horeb) next to the homeland of Moses' wife's family in Midian, Hobab, his brother-in-law, had been living among them. He declined an offer to travel on into Canaan with them, but Moses makes an additional appeal to him. We're not told whether this second appeal is successful, but the &quot;Kenites&quot; (descendants of Hobab) are mentioned on numerous occasions in Judges, I and II Samuel and II Chronicles, indicating their presence among the Israelites. So, perhaps this second appeal by Moses was effective.</p>
<p>Moses had some standard words he used to signal time to travel and time to rest. Look at verses 35-36, &quot;So it was, whenever the ark set out, that Moses said: 'Rise up, O LORD! Let Your enemies be scattered, And let those who hate You flee before You.' And when it rested, he said: 'Return, O LORD, To the many thousands of Israel.'&quot; </p>
