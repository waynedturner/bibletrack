	    <p><font size="3"><b>We find the fullest account of this incident in Mark's Gospel. </b>Jesus, along with Peter, James and John, are returning from the Transfiguration ((<a title="Matthew 17:1-9; Mark 9:2-10; Luke 9:28-36 Summary" href="3-18.html#Moment" title="Matthew 18/Mark 8 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 16:13/Mark8:27 (see notes)</a>. </font>Jesus' remaining disciples had stayed behind and had made an attempt to cast a demon out of a man's son, but with no success. Jesus does cast the demon out, and as a result the boy is healed. We should point out here that <b>not all sickness is to be attributed to demon possession.</b> (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Trial_vs_chastisement.html" title="Trial versus Chastisement" target="_blank">See the article entitled &quot;Trial versus Chastisement&quot; for more details on this subject.</a>) Notice the description of his symptoms in Mark 9:18, &quot;And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid.&quot; There's no question; today's doctors would have diagnosed this young man with some sort of extreme mental illness and medicated him, but Jesus concurs with the diagnosis of his father as demon possession. We see that Jesus' disciples had made a failed attempt. Apparently Jesus' remark was aimed at his disciples when he called them &quot;faithless and perverse&quot; because of their failure. Jesus must have sensed that the disciples were not praying for healing in the proper context of faith. <b>After extricating the demon, Jesus is asked by his disciples why they were not able to do the same.</b> Jesus points out that it was because of a <b>lack of faith.</b> How is this faith acquired? Jesus replies, &quot;by prayer and fasting.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Apostle Paul practiced fasting himself. Since fasting is mentioned in the New Testament approximately 31 times in 26 different verses (see below), it would be difficult to maintain that fasting is not a valid practice for Believers today. Isaiah dealt with the essence of fasting in <a href="10-9.html#Fasting" title="Isaiah 58 Summary" target="_blank">Isaiah 58 (see notes)</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Here are additional references to fasting found in the New Testament:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Jesus fasted (<a title="Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13 Summary" href="1-13.html#Temptation" target="_blank">Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13, see notes</a>)
			<li>Jesus gave instructions on fasting (<a title="Matthew 6 Summary" href="2-2.html#Wait" target="_blank">Matthew 6:16-18, see notes</a>)
			<li>Jesus explained the proper motivation for fasting (<a title="Matthew 9:14-17; Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39 Summary" href="1-25.html#Fast" target="_blank">Matthew 9:14-17; Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39, see notes</a>)
			<li>Jesus makes a passing reference to fasting (<a title="Matthew 15:32-39; Mark 8:1-9 Summary" href="3-14.html#Jesus" target="_blank">Matthew 15:32-39; Mark 8:1-9, see notes</a>)
			<li>The prophetess Anna (<a title="Luke 2 Summary" href="1-9.html#Trip" target="_blank">Luke 2:37, see notes</a>)
			<li>Jesus mentions that a hypocritical Pharisee fasted in a parable (<a title="Luke 18 Summary" href="4-19.html#Pharisees" target="_blank">Luke 18:12, see notes</a>)
			<li>Cornelius had been fasting (<a title="Acts 10 Summary" href="7-16.html#Peter" target="_blank">Acts 10:30, see notes</a>)
			<li>Disciples fasting (<a title="Acts 14 Summary" href="7-20.html#Crowds" target="_blank">Acts 14:23, see notes</a>)
			<li>A reference to the one held by the Jews on the Day of Atonement (<a title="Acts 27 Summary" href="8-9.html#Paul" target="_blank">Acts 27:9, see notes</a>)
			<li>At the commissioning of Barnabas and Saul (<a title="Acts 13 Summary" href="7-20.html#Barnabas" target="_blank">Acts 13:2-3, see notes</a>)
			<li>In instructions to husbands and wives by Paul (<a title="I Corinthians 7 Summary" href="9-22.html#False" target="_blank">II Corinthians 11:27, see notes</a>).		</ul>
		<p>It is difficult from these passages to pull together a comprehensive doctrine on fasting, but it is obvious that the concept has not been invalidated under grace.<b> It would appear that fasting is akin to importunity/persistence.</b> It adds a level of sincerity and urgency to our petitions before God. Incidentally, God knows how sincere we are, but fasting may very well be the key that helps us realize how importantly we regard our own petition. <b>In other words, fasting demonstrates an intensity in prayer that may not be demonstrated any other way.</b></p>

	<p>We're still a few months out at this point, but here Jesus prophesies his betrayal, death and resurrection. I should point out again that Jesus was not captured, he surrendered himself to fulfill prophecy.<b> Jesus was not murdered against his will, he gave himself freely.</b> He clearly states the necessity of his crucifixion in <a title="John 3 Summary" href="5-13.html#Happen" target="_blank">John 12:31-33 (see notes)</a>, just to name a few references.

<p>It is interesting to note the reason Jesus said they should pay the tax levied upon them in verse 27, &quot;...lest we should offend them...&quot; Isn't it interesting that the only account of this tax-paying incident is by the former tax collector, Matthew. <b>Obviously Matthew wants us to know that Jesus complied with the taxation laws, a subject that did not interest Mark, Luke or John.</b> The lesson is clear here: Pay your taxes for the sake of your testimony.</p>
<p><strong>However, there's a little more to this story.</strong> This &quot;tax&quot; (Greek: didrachmon, meaning two drachma) is specifically the temple tax specified in <a href="12-28.html#Stipulations" title="Nehemiah 10 Summary" target="_blank">Nehemiah 10:32 (see notes)</a>. The question Jesus asks of Peter is a general one regarding taxes when he refers in verse 25 to &quot;custom or taxes.&quot; Neither of these words describe the (didrachmon) temple tax of verse 24, but are general words describing taxes. So, here's the question: When a king imposes a tax, does he collect it from his own children? Peter acknowledges that his own children do not pay the king-imposed taxes. Jesus confirms in this scenario that the king's children are, indeed, free from the king's imposed tax. Jesus then in verse 27 indicates that he, for that very reason, should be free from paying the temple tax, but directs Peter to comply for the sake of testimony. Here's the big question: Why should Jesus be free from paying the temple tax? The point is clear. The priests and the Levites were not responsible for paying the temple tax; it was their house (so to speak). Jesus, as the high priest, certainly should have been exempt. However, since he is not acknowledged as such at this point in time by the authorities, Jesus will pay the temple tax.</p>

<p><font size="3">This incident takes place in Capernaum, a city located in Northern Israel on the north coast of the Sea of Galilee.</font><font size="4"> </font><b>This passage has often been used by many to assure that children who pass away before having received Jesus Christ as their personal savior still go to Heaven.</b> While it is true that a child is not held accountable for his sin nature before maturing to a point of recognizing a need for Jesus Christ as savior, it does not appear that this is the passage that teaches that concept. Jesus is using the child as an analogy here to show that a relationship with God does not rest with the powerful or sophisticated, but with a child-like simplicity of the heart.</p>
<p>So, what about the salvation of small children. Where does the Bible teach that these little ones are safe? First of all, David had a clear understanding of the safety of small children in God on the occasion of the death of his first son born to Bathsheba. This was the child born to them out of their adulterous relationship who passed away shortly after birth. After praying, David says in <a title="II Samuel 12 Summary" href="6-27.html#Nathan" target="_blank">II Samuel 12:23 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? <b>I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.&quot;</b> There was a clear understanding in the Old Testament among God's people that they would be reunited with their little ones after death. </p>
<p>The Apostle Paul, in talking about sin and accountability, makes an interesting statement to this effect in <a title="Romans 7 Summary" href="8-21.html#Mission" target="_blank">Romans 10:17 (see notes)</a> says, &quot;So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&quot; Our responsibility as parents is to expose our children to the Word of God and let the Holy Spirit take care of the rest.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, however, that the last verse in this discourse using the child as an object lesson, Jesus says the following in <b>Matthew 18:14</b> (<a href="#Little">see below</a>), &quot;Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.&quot;<b> In light of the discussion on the salvation of children above, this verse lends strength to the doctrine of the safety of children.</b></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Mark and Luke record an excerpt of the conversation on this occasion that Matthew does not in Mark 9:38-41 and Luke 9:49-50.</b> It is triggered by Jesus' statement in Mark 9:37 as he is speaking of the children when he says, &quot;Whoever receives one of these little children in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me, receives not Me but Him who sent Me.&quot; </font>To the Apostles, it doesn't seem right that someone would be casting out demons in the name of Jesus who is not physically walking and ministering with the Apostles themselves. <b>Jesus' reply reinforces the understanding that discipleship cannot be understood in a single context.</b> <a title="Discipleship Summary" href="3-18.html#Discipleship" target="_blank">Click here and read the section entitled, &quot;The difference between discipleship and salvation.&quot;</a> In other words, it is important to understand the different calls to discipleship.

		<p>For people who wonder if it's okay to casually serve Christ, this passage should put that notion to rest. Mark most fully records Jesus' comments on discipleship on this occasion. Don't get hung up on the excision of body parts here. Obviously Jesus knew that a hand or foot does not have a mind of its own. The lesson here is whole-hearted discipleship. <b>Our Lord seeks a full commitment from us on a continual basis as a matter of reasonable discipleship. </b>Paul says the same in <a title="Romans 12 Summary" href="8-21.html#Sacrifice" target="_blank">Romans 12:1-2 (see notes)</a>, &quot;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.  And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.&quot; In other words, discipleship is not a casual affair;<b> those who please Christ present themselves daily as a &quot;living sacrifice&quot; to God's direction.</b></p>

<p>In these five verses Jesus references the &quot;little ones&quot; and then begins a short discourse on lost sheep. Here it is important to realize that the child used in this illustration (<a href="#Children">see above</a>) was to point out the lack of power and sophistication required for a relationship with God. When Jesus was preaching, the Sadducees and Pharisees were the powerful and sophisticated, but the everyday Jew was looked down upon as inferior. Jesus rejected the Jewish leaders and opted rather to minister to &quot;the lost sheep&quot; as we see in the following two verses:</p>
<p><a title="Matthew 10 Summary" href="3-2.html#Jesus" target="_blank">Matthew 10:6 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&quot;<br>
			<a title="Matthew 15 Summary" href="3-14.html#Gentile" target="_blank">Matthew 15:24 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But He answered and said, 'I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.'&quot;</p>
	<p>In this chapter, <b>Jesus is again talking about these lost sheep (Jews) to whom he is presenting himself as their long-awaited Messiah, in compliance with <a href="9-16.html#Messiah" title="Isaiah 9 Summary" target="_blank"> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> The Messianic message of Jesus as the King over the earth based in Jerusalem is the clear message of Jesus at this point in his ministry. So, the &quot;little child&quot; of this passage illustrates the simplicity of faith required for a relationship with God as compared to the sophisticated demeanor of the Jewish leadership which cut them off from God.</p>

		<p>Jesus makes reference to the &quot;church&quot; in this passage before there was a &quot;church&quot; per se. This word &quot;church&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;ekklesia&quot; which literally means &quot;called out assembly.&quot; Therefore, this passage relates to God's &quot;called out assembly&quot; then and now. <b>Specifically, Jesus gives three steps on resolving conflicts within the assembly of those bound together by their common relationship with God.</b></p>
	<p><b>Today, conflict resolution should be handled according to these four steps outlined in this passage:</b></p>
		<ol>
		  <li>The offended party goes to the offender one on one to cite his grievance. </li>
		  <li>If step one fails, the offended party goes back to the offender with one or two witnesses to cite his grievance. <br>
		  Patterned after <a href="4-12.html#Witnesses" title="Deuteronomy 19 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 19:15 (see notes)</a>, &quot;One witness shall not rise against a man concerning any iniquity or any sin that he commits; by the mouth of two or three witnesses the matter shall be established.&quot;</li>
		  <li>If step two fails, the offended party, along with the witnesses cite the grievance to the church. </li>
		  <li>If step three fails, the church excommunicates the offender from the church and treats him as though he were unsaved. <br>
		    The command of excommunication at the church of Corinth seen in <a href="8-29.html#Corinthians" title="I Corinthians 5 Summary" target="_blank">I Corinthians 5:1-13 (see notes)</a> is founded in this principle. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is a painful process within a local body. For that reason, it is often ignored. Scripturally speaking, this is THE WAY the church is directed to handle disputes. Paul makes it clear in <a title="I Corinthians 6 Summary" href="9-2.html#Lawsuits" target="_blank">I Corinthians 6 (see notes)</a> that the church at Corinth was miserably failing by airing out their disputes in court rather than at church among believers. Though unpleasant, conscientious church leadership see this process as their normal administrative duties in shepherding the flock of Believers entrusted to their care.</p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>You will notice that forgiveness is to be freely given WHEN REQUESTED.</strong> </font>Let's pay close attention to the context in which this passage occurs...beginning back in verse 15 (<a href="#Discipline">see above</a>), &quot;Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.&quot; The eventual outcome of the unrepentant offender in this passage is excommunication from the church - not forgiveness. This four-step process is often overlooked by many teachers today in the course of talking about the concept of forgiveness.</p>
<p><font size="3">Take note of another passage of scripture on this issue when Jesus said in <a title="Luke 17 Summary" href="4-15.html#Forgiveness" target="_blank">Luke 17:3 (see notes)</a>, to forgive those who have requested no forgiveness.</b> If they are never held to a position of accountability for their offense, their process of spiritual maturity may be slowed or thwarted. </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Likewise, Jesus forgives us for our sin only when we request it.</b> However, when one declines to ask for that forgiveness, it is not extended. <b>The process of child training taught in scripture involves holding children accountable for offenses and forgiving them when they request it.</b> It is not uncommon for parents who overlook the offenses of their children without rebuke and correction to end up visiting them in prison when they become adults. <b>The prevalent teaching of extending forgiveness freely while requiring no accountability from the offender lacks a good, contextual scriptural foundation.</b> I think the real point of this short-sighted teaching is rather that one gets a release from anger or anguish as a result of being offended. Therefore, the concept to be taught should be one of the Believer committing the wrongdoer to God for correction, and subsequently experience a personal release from responsibility for that wrongdoer so one can go on with one's life without continuing anguish.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">You will notice that the parable Jesus uses equates forgiveness to releasing one from financial debt. Likewise, an offense against another is a debt that should be acknowledged by the debtor. Once acknowledged and forgiveness is sought, it should be freely given.</font></p>
