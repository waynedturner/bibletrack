<ul>
  <li>Jesus follows after his disciples and appears in Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles, six months before his crucifixion.</li>
  <li>All of the events in this passage take place in Jerusalem.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">10 &para; But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. <br />
11 Then the Jews sought Him at the feast, and said, &ldquo;Where is He?&rdquo; <br />
12 And there was much complaining among the people concerning Him. Some said, &ldquo;He is good&rdquo;; others said, &ldquo;No, on the contrary, He deceives the people.&rdquo; <br />
13 However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews. <br />
14 &para; Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught. <br />
15 And the Jews marveled, saying, &ldquo;How does this Man know letters, having never studied?&rdquo; <br />
16 &para; Jesus answered them and said, &ldquo;My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.<br />
17 If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority.<br />
18 He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.<br />
19 Did not Moses give you the law, yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill Me?&rdquo;<br />
20 &para; The people answered and said, &ldquo;You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill You?&rdquo; <br />
21 &para; Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;I did one work, and you all marvel.<br />
22 Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.<br />
23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?<br />
24 Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.&rdquo;<br />
25 &para; Now some of them from Jerusalem said, &ldquo;Is this not He whom they seek to kill? <br />
26 But look! He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is truly the Christ? <br />
27 However, we know where this Man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.&rdquo; <br />
28 &para; Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, saying, &ldquo;You both know Me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.<br />
29 But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He sent Me.&rdquo;<br />
30 &para; Therefore they sought to take Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. <br />
31 And many of the people believed in Him, and said, &ldquo;When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this Man has done?&rdquo; <br />
32 &para; The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him. <br />
33 Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to Him who sent Me.<br />
34 You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you cannot come.&rdquo;<br />
35 &para; Then the Jews said among themselves, &ldquo;Where does He intend to go that we shall not find Him? Does He intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? <br />
36 What is this thing that He said, &ldquo;You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you cannot come&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br />

<p><font size="3">Jesus' brethren had departed to the Feast of Tabernacles (<a title="Jewish Feasts" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Feasts.html" target="_blank">see Jewish Feasts</a>) in Jerusalem leaving Jesus behind. This Jewish festival is sometimes called the Feast of Booths or by its Hebrew equivalent, &quot;sukkot&quot; (meaning booth). This is a fall festival held in the seventh month (late September to late October) - six months before the Passover and the crucifixion of Jesus. Later on, however, Jesus did arrive in Jerusalem without the fanfare of an entourage of followers. Down in Jerusalem the Jewish leaders (here referred to as just &quot;the Jews&quot;) are searching for him; there's a buzz </font>going on there regarding his true identity. Jesus goes into the Temple to teach; it's the fourth day of this eight-day festival (verse 14). <b>What fascinates the Jewish notables is the ability Jesus has to teach without having gone to their own schools.</b> Jesus explains how this is possible in John 7:16, &quot;Jesus answered them and said,<b> 'My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.'&quot;</b> Notice the implication of verse 17, &quot;If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority.&quot; In other words, if you had a relationship with God (as you say you do), God would lead you to accept the doctrine Jesus is teaching. As he makes reference to the supernatural origin of his teaching and the carefully devised plot to put Jesus to death, <b>Jesus is subsequently accused in verse 20 of having a demon.</b></p>
<p>At this point, the verbal duel between Jesus and the Jewish leaders is in full motion. One of the big controversies of Jesus' ministry had been his practice of healing on the sabbath. Jesus addresses that in verses 22-24. He makes the point that Moses neither forbade healing nor circumcising on the sabbath. However, Pharisaical oral tradition had deemed circumcising acceptable, but healing not. Ironically, the forbidden practice of healing on the sabbath was not a problem for the Jewish leaders since they had no ability to do so anyway. In verse 24 Jesus says, &quot;Do not judge according to <strong>appearance</strong>, but judge with righteous judgment.&quot; <b>The Greek word for &quot;appearance&quot; there is &quot;opsis&quot; meaning &quot;that which is thought to be true, but is not necessarily.&quot; In other words, he's publicly questioning their Pharisaical traditions with which they had supplemented the Law of Moses. </b>Their expansion of the Mosaic Law with all of their extra-scriptural stipulations and conditions had transformed its application into an impossible set of &quot;laws&quot; that everyone, including the Pharisees themselves, had difficulty properly observing.</p>
	<p>As Jesus continues to answer questions in the Temple, the common people seem to be responding favorably to what they are hearing. Notice John 7:26, &quot;But look! He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. Do the rulers know indeed that <b>this is truly the Christ?&quot;</b> Jesus is speaking with authority, and the Jewish leaders are not stopping him. Could it be, the people wonder, that the Jewish leaders do acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah?  Keep in mind, &quot;Christ&quot; is the transliteration of the Greek word for &quot;Messiah.&quot; Again, as on previous occasions, that comment moves this day on to a whole new level. With that statement, we no longer have a scenario where a wise man is teaching; <b>we have THE Messiah in the house.</b> At this point, we see in verse 27 a common misconception in that day as a result of Jewish folklore - that the Messiah would have a mysterious and unknown beginning. On the contrary, <a title="Isaiah 9 Summary" href="9-16.html#Messiah" target="_blank">Isaiah 9:6-7 (see notes)</a> had prophesied the birth of the Messiah. It is not clear whether or not the demonstrated ignorance of Isaiah's prophetic statement by the Jewish leadership was intentional or due to a simple lack of scriptural knowledge. In the next few verses as Jesus continues to teach, the Jewish leaders seek a way to put a stop to it; they would have taken him prisoner, but no one would touch him because verse 30 says, &quot;his hour had not yet come.&quot; In other words, it wasn't time for the crucifixion at this point. Jesus talks about his departure (an obvious reference to his ascension), but the people don't comprehend it. As the Jewish leaders are looking for a way to stop him, he seems to just disappear.</p>
<p><a name="Jesus"></a><font size="4"><b>Jesus breaks it wide open (John 7:37-53)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">37 &para; On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.<br />
38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&rdquo;<br />
39 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. <br />
40 &para; Therefore many from the crowd, when they heard this saying, said, &ldquo;Truly this is the Prophet.&rdquo; <br />
41 Others said, &ldquo;This is the Christ.&rdquo; &para; But some said, &ldquo;Will the Christ come out of Galilee? <br />
42 Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem, where David was?&rdquo; <br />
43 So there was a division among the people because of Him. <br />
44 Now some of them wanted to take Him, but no one laid hands on Him. <br />
45 &para; Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, &ldquo;Why have you not brought Him?&rdquo; <br />
46 &para; The officers answered, &ldquo;No man ever spoke like this Man!&rdquo; <br />
47 &para; Then the Pharisees answered them, &ldquo;Are you also deceived? <br />
48 Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in Him? <br />
49 But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.&rdquo; <br />
50 &para; Nicodemus (he who came to Jesus by night, being one of them) said to them, <br />
51 &ldquo;Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing?&rdquo; <br />
52 &para; They answered and said to him, &ldquo;Are you also from Galilee? Search and look, for no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.&rdquo; <br />
53 &para; And everyone went to his own house. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Verse 14 tells us that the previous confrontation had taken place about half way through the eight-day Feast of Tabernacles. Now, verse 37 is clearly the last day of the festival. Jesus makes a defining statement in verses 37-38, <b>&quot;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&quot;</b> This statement was particularly meaningful to the Jewish audience that day because of the manner in which the Jews observed the Feast of Tabernacles on this last day. Extra-scriptural Jewish sources tell us that the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles included a daily procession of priests from the temple to the Pool of Siloam, from which they drew water that was then poured out at the base the temple altar. So you can see the relevance of Jesus' declaration concerning spiritual, living water in verse 37. The particular scripture to which Jesus may be alluding here in verse 38 is likely <a href="10-6.html#Return" title="Isaiah 44 Summary" target="_blank">Isaiah 44:3 (see notes)</a>, &quot;For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, 	And floods on the dry ground; 	I will pour My Spirit on your descendants, 	And My blessing on your offspring.&quot;</p>
	<p>Verse 39 establishes that this is indeed an invitation for salvation. So they begin to wonder, is he a prophet, or is he the Messiah. That distinction between Jesus' identity as a &quot;prophet&quot; or the &quot;Christ&quot; (aka Messiah) in verses 40-41 demonstrates that apparently the Jews were being taught that the &quot;prophet&quot; prophesied by Moses in <a title="Deuteronomy 18 Summary" href="6-26.html#Two" target="_blank">Luke 24:27 (see notes)</a> that Moses prophesied concerning the Messiah when he says, &quot;And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.&quot; <br>
    We see a similar discussion in <a title="John 1 Summary" href="1-13.html#Identify" target="_blank">John 1:21 (see notes)</a> between Jesus and the Pharisees, <br>
    And they asked him, &quot;What then? Are you Elijah?&quot;<br>
    He said, &quot;I am not.&quot;<br>
    &quot;Are you the Prophet?&quot; <br>
    And he answered, &quot;No.&quot; <br>
    It is obvious that Jewish teaching of Jesus' day differentiated between the prophet of <a title="Deuteronomy 18 Summary" href="4-12.html#Prophet" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 18:15-22 (see notes)</a>, and the Messiah. </p>
	<p><b>For additional insight into this distinction, read the following two articles:</b></p>

		<p>Some are thinking really hard in verse 41, &quot;...<b>Will the Christ come out of Galilee?&quot;</b> They were referencing <a title="Micah 5 Summary" href="9-17.html#Deliverer" target="_blank">Micah 5:2 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>The woman taken in adultery (John 8:1-11)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. <br />
2 &para; Now early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them. <br />
3 Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, <br />
4 they said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. <br />
5 Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?&rdquo; <br />
6 This they said, testing Him, that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though He did not hear. <br />
7 &para; So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.&rdquo;<br />
8 And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. <br />
9 Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. <br />
10 When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, &ldquo;Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?&rdquo;<br />
11 &para; She said, &ldquo;No one, Lord.&rdquo; &para; And Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.&rdquo;<br />
          </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Here's one of our very familiar stories of scripture.<b> It is often misused by people with political agendas to teach tolerance toward sin, but the real teaching here is a lesson on hypocrisy.</b> By the way, <b>the Jewish leaders seek to use this incident as an opportunity to trap Jesus</b> into public, prosecutable blasphemy. They point out that this adulterous woman is clearly in violation of written Jewish law, not just oral tradition. In verse 4, the scribes and Pharisees explain to Jesus, &quot;Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act.&quot; Then they cite the Mosaic Law in verse 5, but leaving a significant portion out; <b>where is the man?</b> After all, <a title="Leviticus 20 Summary" href="3-8.html#Category" target="_blank">Leviticus 20:10 (see notes)</a> actually says, &quot;The man who commits adultery with another man&rsquo;s wife, he who commits adultery with his neighbor&rsquo;s wife, <b>the adulterer and the adulteress, shall surely be put to death.&quot;</b> Again I say, <b>&quot;Where's the man?&quot;</b> Not that it always stopped them, but secular historians tell us that the Jews did not have Roman authority to execute capital punishment except in the case of temple violations. Let's face it, this whole charade is just to set a trap for Jesus (verse 6); they couldn't care less about the woman actually taken in adultery.</p>
	<p>Well, their object was to get Jesus to dispute Mosaic Law. However, the tables quickly turn on them when they are directed by Jesus in verse 7, &quot;He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.&quot; Oooops...didn't think of that...I mean...the actual stoning. In fact, none of them had the authority from the Roman government to execute another for sexual violations. And then there's that writing on the ground by Jesus - what did it say? <b>Whatever Jesus wrote on the ground in front of  her accusers had an impact on them.</b> I'm guessing that whatever it was exposed their own hypocrisy to the point that it was too embarrassing to stay around. <b>Did Jesus condone sinful conduct? No!</b> Look at what he told the woman at the conclusion of this ordeal in verse 11, &quot;Neither do I condemn you: <b>go, and sin no more.&quot;</b></p>
	<p>Incidentally, many often ask why the man who was &quot;caught in the act&quot; didn't accompany the woman to the stoning party per the Mosaic Law. First of all, it's doubtful that they ever intended to stone the woman in the first place since they lacked authority to do so. The object was to trap Jesus making statements contrary to Mosaic Law. However, some have suggested that perhaps the woman was caught with a Roman. The Jewish leadership had no authority whatsoever to bring a Roman citizen to this party. However, that's just a conjecture.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Another bout with the religious leaders (John 8:12-29)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">12 &para; Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, &ldquo;I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.&rdquo;<br />
13 &para; The Pharisees therefore said to Him, &ldquo;You bear witness of Yourself; Your witness is not true.&rdquo; <br />
14 &para; Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Even if I bear witness of Myself, My witness is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.<br />
15 You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.<br />
16 And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent Me.<br />
17 It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.<br />
18 I am One who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me.&rdquo;<br />
19 &para; Then they said to Him, &ldquo;Where is Your Father?&rdquo; &para; Jesus answered, &ldquo;You know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.&rdquo;<br />
20 &para; These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on Him, for His hour had not yet come. <br />
21 &para; Then Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;I am going away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.&rdquo;<br />
22 &para; So the Jews said, &ldquo;Will He kill Himself, because He says, &lsquo;Where I go you cannot come&rsquo;?&rdquo; <br />
23 &para; And He said to them, &ldquo;You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.<br />
24 Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.&rdquo;<br />
25 &para; Then they said to Him, &ldquo;Who are You?&rdquo; &para; And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.<br />
26 I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him.&rdquo;<br />
27 &para; They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father. <br />
28 &para; Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things.<br />
29 And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things that please Him.&rdquo;<br />
          </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>Notice John 8:12, &quot;Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, 'I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.'&quot; The woman taken in adultery was apparently an interruption to the dialogue between Jesus and the Jewish leaders in John 7 (<a href="#Jesus">see above</a>). Now, verse 12 frames the next topic of discussion with the Jewish leaders as Jesus has just issued a general call for disciples. To properly understand this discussion, let's make certain that we understand the invitation. Jesus is proposing that the revelation of God (&quot;the light of life&quot;) comes through following Jesus himself. That's a strong, unpalatable statement - one that the Jewish leaders feel they must immediately and adamantly dismiss. Their very bold reply to Jesus in verse 13 is basically, <b>&quot;You're a liar!&quot;</b> Jesus goes on to explain his relationship with the God of Israel, mostly falling on unreceptive ears. Jesus is quite clear as he addresses them, more so than at any time previously.</p>
	<p>Remember the discussion regarding the physical origin of Jesus back in 7:40-42 (<a href="#Jesus">see above</a>)? Well...Jesus brings that up here in verse 14. Without knowledge of his origin, they had dismissed Jesus as a liar. Who cares about the facts, anyway? Then the dialogue turns to a discussion about references. Jesus declares in verse 18, &quot;the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me.&quot; Jesus follows this statement with an indictment in verse 19 when he says, &quot;You know neither Me nor My Father.&quot; If you ever wonder why Jesus was not more tolerant of the Pharisees, here's your answer: They were professional religionists who did not have a relationship with God. That is a very dangerous combination. &quot;Yeah, but aren't all religions good if you're sincere?&quot; one might ask. Read what Jesus tells these professional religionists in verse 24, &quot;Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.&quot; Here's the deal; Jesus is the only way to Heaven - then and now.</p>
	<p>Now, you might wonder what Jesus expects this dialogue with the Jewish leaders to accomplish. There's the expected outcome in verse 28, &quot;Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things.&quot; This is Jesus' direct reference to the crucifixion at the hands of these very Jewish leaders. Jesus has been prophesying his crucifixion throughout his earthly ministry. </p>
	<p><b>Consider the following references Jesus had already made regarding his crucifixion:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The destruction and resurrection of his body in three days (<a title="John 2 Summary" href="1-17.html#Born" target="_blank">John 3:14, see notes</a>)		</ul>

33 &para; They answered Him, &ldquo;We are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can You say, &lsquo;You will be made free&rsquo;?&rdquo; <br />
34 &para; Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin.<br />

42 &para; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me.<br />
43 Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word.<br />
44 You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it.<br />
45 But because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me.<br />
46 Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?<br />
47 He who is of God hears God&rsquo;s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.&rdquo;<br />
48 &para; Then the Jews answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?&rdquo; <br />
49 &para; Jesus answered, &ldquo;I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.<br />
50 And I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks and judges.<br />
51 Most assuredly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he shall never see death.&rdquo;<br />
52 &para; Then the Jews said to Him, &ldquo;Now we know that You have a demon! Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and You say, &lsquo;If anyone keeps My word he shall never taste death.&rsquo;<br />
53 Are You greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead. Who do You make Yourself out to be?&rdquo; <br />
54 &para; Jesus answered, &ldquo;If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing. It is My Father who honors Me, of whom you say that He is your God.<br />
55 Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say, &ldquo;I do not know Him,&rsquo; I shall be a liar like you; but I do know Him and keep His word.<br />
56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.&rdquo;<br />
57 &para; Then the Jews said to Him, &ldquo;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?&rdquo; <br />
58 &para; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.&rdquo;<br />
59 &para; Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. </font> </p>

	<p>Notice verse 30, &quot;As He spoke these words, <b>many believed in Him.&quot;</b> Now we see in verses 31-32 <b>a distinction between salvation and discipleship,</b> <b>&quot;</b><b>If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&quot;</b> Jesus! <b>Did you say free!</b> That sets a fire under the Pharisees when they make their catty remark in verse 33, &quot;<strong>We are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. </strong>How can You say, 'You will be made free'?&quot; That sets the stage for the remaining portion of the chapter. </p>
	<p><a title="Discipleship Summary" href="3-18.html#Discipleship" target="_blank">(Click here to see the notes regarding discipleship/salvation based upon Matthew 16:24-27; Mark 8:34-38; Luke 9:23-26.)</a></p>
		<p>Notice the relationship between faith in God and faith in Jesus from the words of Jesus in verse 42, &quot;If God were your Father, you would love Me.&quot; In other words, Jesus and God are inseparable - then and now. Speaking of being descendants of Abraham, Jesus makes his point regarding their highly-valued heritage in verse 44, &quot;<strong>You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do.</strong> He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it.&quot; <b>Hey guys! Not Abraham, but Satan!</b> Of course they take great exception to this assessment of their spiritual blindness and continue to argue this point. <b>Jesus then invokes the name of Abraham once again in John 8:56,</b> &quot;Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.&quot; Whoa! Now that's heavy! Look at the way <b>Paul explains it in <a title="Galatians 3 Summary" href="1-22.html#Top" target="_blank"> Genesis 12:3 (see notes)</a>, &quot;...<b>And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed,&quot; that's talking about us - Christians!</b> So, the physical descendants of Abraham got land and physical prosperity out of the covenant, but <b>we all get Christ and eternal life</b> out of it. So, you see, when God gave Abraham the promise of innumerable descendants, he was talking about doing so through the Redeemer, Jesus Christ. </p>
	<p>Here's another strong statement by Jesus in verse 47, &quot;He who is of God hears God&rsquo;s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.&quot; With that statement, perhaps Jesus meant to remind them of <a href="8-14.html#Wisdom" title="Proverbs 28 Summary" target="_blank">Proverbs 28:9 (see notes)</a>, &quot;One who turns away his ear from hearing the law, 	Even his prayer is an abomination.&quot; Whether they saw the relationship or not, Jesus plainly declares in verse 51, &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he shall never see death.&quot;</p>
	<p>Jesus caps off this discussion by making a statement that <b>identifies himself as God</b> in verse 58, &quot;Jesus said to them, 'Most assuredly, I say to you, <b>before Abraham was, I AM.'&quot;</b> What's wrong with that grammar? It's a play on words flashing back to the burning bush from which God spoke to Moses in <a title="Exodus 3 Summary" href="2-9.html#Bush" target="_blank">Exodus 3:14 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM.' And He said, 'Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.'&quot; In Greek, &quot;was&quot; is the aorist infinitive of &quot;ginomai&quot; literally meaning &quot;before Abraham WAS BORN, I AM.&quot; <b>That statement is, in essence, Jesus proclaiming himself to be God in the flesh</b> without actually saying those exact words. Their reaction? Verse 59 says, &quot;Then they took up stones to throw at Him.&quot;</p>
