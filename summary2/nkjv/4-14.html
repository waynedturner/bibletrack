<p><a name="Once"></a><font size="4"><b>Once is enough! (Deuteronomy 24:1-4)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it happens that she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some uncleanness in her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house,<br />
2 when she has departed from his house, and goes and becomes another man&rsquo;s wife,<br />
3 if the latter husband detests her and writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies who took her as his wife,<br />
4 then her former husband who divorced her must not take her back to be his wife after she has been defiled; for that is an abomination before the LORD, and you shall not bring sin on the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s a provision under the Mosaic Law that <b>restricts a man from remarrying a woman after his divorce from her</b> and her subsequent remarriage to another man. It would appear that this law is designed to protect the second marriage from emotions which may be potentially revived between the original marriage partners. This is a bridge-burning law that says,<b> &quot;You can&#39;t go back!&quot;</b></p>

<p>What might this &quot;uncleanness&quot; of verse 1 involve? After all, the realization that a Hebrew woman wasn&#39;t a virgin after one marries her is dealt with in <a href="4-13.html#Betrothal" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 22 Summary">Deuteronomy 22:13-30 (see notes)</a>, and the penalty for this unfaithfulness was stoning to death - no divorce required there. Likewise, death by stoning is the outcome specified for adultery in <a href="3-16.html#Adultery" target="_blank" title="Numbers 5 Summary">Numbers 5:11-31 (see notes)</a>. However, there are at least a couple of situations that come to mind where a woman taken in marriage may not be a virgin. In <a href="2-19.html#Laws" target="_blank" title="Exodus 22 Summary">Exodus 22:16-17 (see notes)</a> we see a situation where an innocent woman is no longer a virgin. Another scenario might be the woman taken prisoner and subsequently taken as a wife by her Hebrew captor as seen in <a href="4-13.html#Wife" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 21 Summary">Deuteronomy 21:10-14 (see notes)</a>. In both instances we have the possibility that one might marry a woman who was not a virgin at marriage and become dissatisfied afterward because of the discovered &quot;uncleanness.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Miscellaneous"></a><font size="4"><b>Miscellaneous laws (Deuteronomy 24:5-22)</b></font></p>

<p><b><font size="3">Some criminal and civil laws:</font></b></p>

<ul>

	The millstone was made up of two stones, a really big stone as the base with a small stone of five pounds or so that fit one&#39;s hand for the purpose of grinding grain. A poor person depended upon this tool for his food. This tool could not be taken as security for a loan.</li>

<p>While the Hebrews were the covenant people (their relationship with God), it is interesting to note the provisions made in the Law of Moses for foreigners. Notice verses 17, 18, 20 and 21. As a matter of fact, notice <a href="4-8.html#Transplant" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 10 Summary">Deuteronomy 10:19 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.&quot; This generosity stopped short, however, of ever being king over Israelites (<a href="4-12.html#Rules" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 17 Summary">Deuteronomy 17:15, see notes</a>), and a Hebrew COULD charge interest on a loan to a stranger, but NOT a fellow Hebrew (<a href="4-13.html#Laws" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 23 Summary">Deuteronomy 23:20, see notes</a>). Another interesting provision for the foreigner living among the Hebrews was that he could be given certain foods to eat that were unclean to the Hebrews and forbidden (<a href="4-10.html#Food" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 14 Summary">Deuteronomy 14:21, see notes</a>).</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Ouch! Forty will do! (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;If there is a dispute between men, and they come to court, that the judges may judge them, and they justify the righteous and condemn the wicked,<br />
2 then it shall be, if the wicked man deserves to be beaten, that the judge will cause him to lie down and be beaten in his presence, according to his guilt, with a certain number of blows.<br />
3 Forty blows he may give him and no more, lest he should exceed this and beat him with many blows above these, and your brother be humiliated in your sight. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">A beatin&#39; has an upper limit of 40 whacks. I guess that&#39;s some consolation. Rabbis in the first century decreed 39 stripes instead of 40; they wanted to be certain there was a margin for error so as to not exceed the letter of the law in case of a miscount. The Apostle Paul was so beaten five times according to his own words in <a href="9-22.html#False" target="_blank" title="II Corinthians 11 Summary">II Corinthians 11:24 (see notes)</a>, &quot;From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one.&quot; In the case of these Law-prescribed beatings, the judge was to oversee the beating as the beatee was to lie, face down, on the ground for the punishment.</font></p>

<p title="I Corinthians 9 Summary"><a name="Oxen"></a><font size="4"><b>Let the oxen eat while they work! (Deuteronomy 25:4)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p title="I Corinthians 9 Summary"><font size="2">4 &para; &ldquo;You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p title="I Corinthians 9 Summary">Paul makes reference to this verse when talking about preachers getting paid in <a href="10-28.html#Instructions" target="_blank" title="I Timothy 5 Summary">I Timothy 5:18 (see notes)</a>, &quot;For the Scripture says, &#39;You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,&#39; and, &#39;The laborer is worthy of his wages.&#39;&quot; Paul also quotes this verse in <a href="9-2.html#Apostle" target="_blank">I Corinthians 9:<font size="3">9 (see notes)</font></a><font size="3">, &quot;For it is written in the law of Moses, &#39;You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.&#39; Is it oxen God is concerned about?&quot;</font></p>

<p><a name="Wife"></a><font size="4"><b>But I don&#39;t want my brother&#39;s wife! (Deuteronomy 25:5-10)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">5 &para; &ldquo;If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies and has no son, the widow of the dead man shall not be married to a stranger outside the family; her husband&rsquo;s brother shall go in to her, take her as his wife, and perform the duty of a husband&rsquo;s brother to her.<br />
6 And it shall be that the firstborn son which she bears will succeed to the name of his dead brother, that his name may not be blotted out of Israel.<br />
7 But if the man does not want to take his brother&rsquo;s wife, then let his brother&rsquo;s wife go up to the gate to the elders, and say, &ldquo;My husband&rsquo;s brother refuses to raise up a name to his brother in Israel; he will not perform the duty of my husband&rsquo;s brother.&rsquo;<br />
8 Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him. But if he stands firm and says, &ldquo;I do not want to take her,&rsquo;<br />
9 then his brother&rsquo;s wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, remove his sandal from his foot, spit in his face, and answer and say, &ldquo;So shall it be done to the man who will not build up his brother&rsquo;s house.&rsquo;<br />
10 And his name shall be called in Israel, &ldquo;The house of him who had his sandal removed.&rsquo; </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Israel, it was your family obligation after your brother&#39;s untimely death to take his wife and give her an opportunity to bear a child. So, you refuse? Better get ready for some public humiliation then...in front of the whole city. The dead brother&#39;s name would be continued through the birth of the son conceived under this provision of the Law.</p>

<p><b>This procedure was not new under Mosaic Law. </b>We first get a glimpse of this brotherly responsibility in <a href="2-3.html#Struggle" target="_blank" title="Genesis 38 Summary">Genesis 38 (see notes)</a> with Judah and his first son, Er. We then see this scenario played out between Ruth and Boaz in the <a href="5-10.html" target="_blank" title="Ruth Summary">Book of Ruth (see notes)</a>. Some have sought to make this law socially compatible with contemporary standards by specifying that the obligation existed only when the brother had not previously married prior to his brother&#39;s death. There is no scriptural evidence to support this notion. In fact, providing an heir was the issue here. The widow needed an heir for her dead husband, and the remaining brother was obligated to provide that heir in his brother&#39;s name - without regard to the one or more wives he might already have. In Hebrew culture, marriages under these circumstances are known as &quot;levirate&quot; marriages.</p>

<p>A property-rights issue is probably in view here. If a widow without children marries outside of her husband&#39;s clan, that portion of the family inheritance of land may end up in the hands of another clan. This insures that the property stays where it was intended. Incidentally, the special circumstances of this law overrides the stipulations of <a href="3-7.html#Taboos" target="_blank" title="Leviticus 18 Summary">Leviticus 18:16 (see notes)</a> and <a href="3-8.html#Category" target="_blank" title="Leviticus 20 Summary">Leviticus 20:21 (see notes)</a>. Both of those passages forbid one from marrying his brother&#39;s wife.</p>

<p>Jesus touches on the provisions of this law when asked a question by the Sadducees (<a href="5-9.html#Sadducees" target="_blank" title="Matthew 22; Mark 12; Luke 20 Summary">Matthew 22:23-33; Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40 - see notes</a>).</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Wives, stay out of your husband&#39;s fight! (Deuteronomy 25:11-12)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">11 &para; &ldquo;If two men fight together, and the wife of one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of the one attacking him, and puts out her hand and seizes him by the genitals,<br />
12 then you shall cut off her hand; your eye shall not pity her.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Ouch! </font>A wife can lose a hand by coming to the aid of her husband in a fight...if she&#39;s not careful. Punch, kick, bite, scratch if she likes, but she must be careful about the bodily location of her aggression.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Don&#39;t you dare pull out those phony scales! (Deuteronomy 25:13-16)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">13 &para; &ldquo;You shall not have in your bag differing weights, a heavy and a light.<br />
14 You shall not have in your house differing measures, a large and a small.<br />
15 You shall have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure, that your days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD your God is giving you.<br />
16 For all who do such things, all who behave unrighteously, are an abomination to the LORD your God. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Inaccurate scales are illegal, and it&#39;s illegal to cheat someone by deliberately falsely weighing the product. Interesting...consumer protection laws even back then. Specifically, if one were buying, he might have pulled out a heavier weight to balance it on his scales against the product he was purchasing - getting more for his money. On the other hand, if he were selling, he might pull out the lesser weight against which he balanced the product, thus giving less product for the purchase price. That was illegal under Mosaic Law.</font></p>

<p><a name="Amalek"></a><font size="4"><b>We&#39;re never forgetting Amalek! (Deuteronomy 25:17-19)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">17 &para; &ldquo;Remember what Amalek did to you on the way as you were coming out of Egypt,<br />
18 how he met you on the way and attacked your rear ranks, all the stragglers at your rear, when you were tired and weary; and he did not fear God.<br />
19 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD your God has given you rest from your enemies all around, in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, that you will blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. You shall not forget. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The Amalekites...t</font>hey hate us, and we&#39;re not crazy about them. Remember when God judged Israel for refusing to go take Canaan after the return of the 12 spies in Numbers 14. They decided to try to reverse God&#39;s judgment by going up against the Amalekites into Canaan by their own might and were thoroughly whipped in battle (<a href="3-21.html#Israel" target="_blank" title="Numbers 14 Summary">Number 14:39-45, see notes</a>). However, <b>the reference here looks back to their immediate exodus from Egypt when the Amalekites dogged them in <a href="2-16.html#War" target="_blank" title="Exodus 17 Summary">Exodus 17:8-13</a></b><a href="2-16.html#War" target="_blank" title="Exodus 17 Summary"> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> That was Israel&#39;s first big battle, and they prevailed. But wait! That&#39;s still not enough! <b>This revives under Saul in </b><a href="5-16.html#Saul" target="_blank" title="I Samuel 15 Summary"><b>I Samuel 15</b> (see notes</a>)<b> when he goes after the Amalekites...and he&#39;s motivated by this very command.</b></p>

<p>According to the Jewish Study Bible, &quot;These verses are read liturgically on the Sabbath before Purim, since according to Jewish tradition, Haman, the evil protagonist of Esther, is an Amalekite (see 1 Sam. 15:8 and Esth. 8:3).&quot;</p>

12 &para; &ldquo;When you have finished laying aside all the tithe of your increase in the third year&mdash;the year of tithing&mdash;and have given it to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, so that they may eat within your gates and be filled,<br />

<p>They were not to just take their offerings and leave - had to recite to the officiating priest the history lesson of their people going back to Jacob, the Aramean/Syrian (verses 5-9). This all took place back at the location of the tabernacle. <b>Every third year the tithe was taken </b>and given for the provision of the poor and Levites (verse 12) - probably not taken to the central location of the tabernacle, but to a place designated by each tribe. There was a ritual saying that went with this offering as well (verses 13-15) which offered a commitment to God and expressed thankfulness for his provisions. Again, notice that this was a mandatory tithe which, in effect, was how the government provided for the needs of their government servants and poor.</p>

<p>For more on this every-third-year tithe, <a href="4-10.html#Tithing" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 14 Summary">see the notes on Deuteronomy 14:22-29</a>.</p>

<p>The second giving of the Law is now complete. These four verses cap it off with an exhortation to adhere carefully to the stipulations of the covenant the Lord has established with the Hebrews. The special status of the Hebrew people before God is once again stated in these verses.</p>

14 &para; &ldquo;And the Levites shall speak with a loud voice and say to all the men of Israel:<br />
15 &ldquo;Cursed is the one who makes a carved or molded image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret.&rsquo; &para; &ldquo;And all the people shall answer and say, &lsquo;Amen!&rsquo;<br />

<p>Remember the Gerizim/Ebal (<a href="4-10.html#Love" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 11 Summary">Deuteronomy 11 (see notes</a>) with <b>2,000,000+ Hebrews shouting their acceptance of the cursings and blessings of the law?</b> Here are some more specific instructions about how this event is to take place, which doesn&#39;t actually happen until Joshua 8. Hey! Be patient; <b>it takes time to put together a 2,000,000-voice choir.</b> The actual event takes place in<a href="4-21.html#Event" target="_blank" title="Joshua 8 Summary"> Joshua 8:29-35 (see notes)</a>. It&#39;ll be an earth-shaking vocal experience!</p>

<p>The advance team will write &quot;all the words of this law&quot; (verse 3) upon stones on the other side of Jordan before this big event. These two mountain tops are about one mile apart over on the Canaan side of the Jordan River. Half of the Hebrew tribes will stand on Mount Ebal (Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali); the other half will stand on Mount Gerizim (Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:). The Levites will read the curses, and the people on the mountains will cry &quot;amen.&quot; Verses 15-26 list those curses which are to be read at that big gathering. We&#39;ll see the reading of the blessings with additional curses in <a href="4-16.html#Obey" target="_blank" title="Deuteronomy 28 Summary">Deuteronomy 28 (see notes)</a>.</p>
