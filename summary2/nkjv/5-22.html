        <p>According to the superscription of this Psalm, it was written on the occasion of <a title="I Samuel 21 Summary" href="5-19.html#Alive" target="_blank">I Samuel 21:10-15 (see notes)</a>. You remember when David fled to the safety of the Philistines for refuge because Saul was trying to kill him. David shows up in Gath and acts insane so as to create the impression that he is no threat to them any longer. Those weren't the best of times for David, but he wrote this Psalm during that time of crisis. As you can see from this Psalm, David is pretty certain he's experiencing just a temporary setback. After all, he's the King of Israel. Unfortunately, he and Samuel are the only ones who know it at that time. Saul's coming to that realization...and therein lies the big problem. Because of God's promise, David is able to say in verse 4, &quot;In God (I will praise His word), In God I have put my trust; I will not fear. What can flesh do to me?&quot;</p>
	<p>When God makes a covenant, God never violates his own covenant. David has been anointed King of Israel by Samuel himself (<a title="I Samuel 16 Summary" href="5-16.html#Call" target="_blank">I Samuel 16, see notes</a>). Undoubtedly it is for this reason that David can proclaim in verse 9, &quot;When I cry out to You, Then my enemies will turn back; <b>This I know, because God is for me.&quot;</b> David knew that he was living under the umbrella of God's covenant and was serving his purpose.</p>

They were well fitted for being sung by the way from their peculiar form, and from the sentiments they express. &ldquo;They are characterized by brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora [i.e., repetition], and by their epigrammatic style...More than half of them are cheerful, and all of them hopeful.&rdquo; They are sometimes called &ldquo;Pilgrim Songs.&rdquo; Four of them were written by David, one (127) by Solomon, and the rest are anonymous.</font></p></td>

	<p><font size="3">&quot;</font>In my distress I cried to the LORD, And He heard me.&quot; These are words likely written while David was fleeing Saul's death sentence (<a title="I Samuel 21-22 Summary" href="5-19.html#Alive" target="_blank">I Samuel 21-22, see notes</a>), although we have no way of knowing exactly when this Psalm was penned. There are two geographic references in this Psalm. Meshech in the far north (Genesis 10:2) and Kedar (Jeremiah 2:10) in the Syro-Arabian Desert are too far apart to be the literal locations where David is residing at the time. He undoubtedly uses these place names to suggest being far from home. <strong>Notice how David sums up his circumstances in verse 7, &quot;I am for peace; But when I speak, they are for war.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><font size="3">It is likely that Psalms 140-142 were written at about the same period of time in David's life. The introduction to Psalm 142 (<a href="5-19.html#Killed" target="_blank">I Samuel 24, see notes</a>). <font size="3">That would place this writing during the period of time when he is hiding in the cave from Saul. </font>David asks for deliverance from his enemies. It is interesting that David never mentions Saul by name when referencing his enemies.</p>
<p>By the way, Paul quotes a portion of verse 3 in <a href="8-13.html#No" title="Romans 3 Summary" target="_blank">Romans 3:13 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Keep me from evil (Psalm 141)<br>

Give ear to my voice when I cry out to You. <br>
2 	Let my prayer be set before You as incense,<br>
The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. <br>
3 	Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth;<br>
Keep watch over the door of my lips. <br>
4 	Do not incline my heart to any evil thing,<br>
To practice wicked works<br>
With men who work iniquity;<br>
And do not let me eat of their delicacies. <br>
5 	Let the righteous strike me;<br>

6 	Their judges are overthrown by the sides of the cliff,<br>
And they hear my words, for they are sweet. <br>
7 	Our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave,<br>
As when one plows and breaks up the earth. <br>
8 	But my eyes are upon You, O GOD the Lord;<br>
In You I take refuge;<br>
Do not leave my soul destitute. <br>
9 	Keep me from the snares they have laid for me,<br>
And from the traps of the workers of iniquity. <br>
10 	Let the wicked fall into their own nets,<br>
While I escape safely. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">This Psalm of David seems to flow with 140 and 142. It is likely, therefore, that it was written from the cave at the same time as 142 (<a href="#Cried">see notes below</a>). </font>David expresses his strong desire to speak and act only in a way pleasing to God. People tend to develop a more cohesive relationship with God during times of distress. David's adversity draws him into a closer walk with God.</p>
<p><a name="Cried"></a><font size="4"><b>I cried unto the Lord (Psalm 142)<br>

  <p><font size="2">A Contemplation of David. A Prayer when he was in the cave. <br>

With my voice to the LORD I make my supplication. <br>
2 	I pour out my complaint before Him;<br>
I declare before Him my trouble. <br>
3 	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,<br>
Then You knew my path.<br>
In the way in which I walk<br>
They have secretly set a snare for me. <br>
4 	Look on my right hand and see,<br>
For there is no one who acknowledges me;<br>
Refuge has failed me;<br>
No one cares for my soul. <br>
5 	I cried out to You, O LORD:<br>
I said, &ldquo;You are my refuge,<br>
My portion in the land of the living. <br>
6 	Attend to my cry,<br>
For I am brought very low;<br>
Deliver me from my persecutors,<br>
For they are stronger than I. <br>
7 	Bring my soul out of prison,<br>
That I may praise Your name;<br>
The righteous shall surround me,<br>
For You shall deal bountifully with me.&rdquo; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The superscription here references a cave. This could be the cave of Adullam (<a title="I Samuel 22 Summary" href="5-19.html#Killed" target="_blank">I Samuel 24, see notes</a>). In both instances David was fleeing the wrath of Saul...yet he had time to write poetry, not to mention the presence of mind to do so. We really get some insight into the thinking processes that were going on in David's mind during this period of rejection. He feels that God is all he has and looks forward to the time when his soul is delivered out of prison, he is surrounded by righteous people and experiencing bountiful blessings from God.</p>
<p><b>I'm struck by the expression of helplessness from the future reigning King of Israel. Notice David's own words about his plight:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>&quot;my spirit was overwhelmed within me&quot; verse 3
			<li>&quot;They have secretly set a snare for me&quot; verse 3
			<li>&quot;there is no one who acknowledges me&quot; verse 4
			<li>&quot;Refuge has failed me&quot; verse 4
			<li>&quot;No one cares for my soul&quot; verse 4
			<li>&quot;I am brought very low&quot; verse 6
		</ul>
	<p><b>And you think you have problems!</b> It just goes to show you: <b>When it seems hopeless, God is really the one in control.</b> It is important to keep in mind that David had been anointed King of Israel prior to this occasion - back in <a href="5-16.html#Call" title="I Samuel 16 Summary" target="_blank">I Samuel 16 (see notes)</a>. NOTE: The road to success isn't always paved.</p>
