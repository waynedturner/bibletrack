<p><font size="3">Luke just records that Jesus preached in the temple each day during the gathering in Jerusalem for the passover. John specifies that Jesus preached the prerequisite to eternal life - believing on Jesus, trusting Jesus as Savior. He makes the contrast between abiding in light and darkness and then issues a stern warning regarding judgment on those who reject Jesus as Savior. There&#39;s a solemn warning applicable to all in John 12:48, &quot;He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him&mdash;the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day.&quot; We will all be judged by the message of Jesus. Just a few hours later, Jesus would make this statement in John 14:6, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.&quot; These two verses stand on their own without commentary: <b>The only way to God is through Jesus Christ.</b> God has not provided an alternate means of salvation - just Jesus as Savior.</font></p>

<p>The Jewish leaders were unable to locate Jesus except for the times when crowds were gathered around him. They seemed to always lose respect in the eyes of the Jewish masses as a result of the confrontations they had with Jesus on those occasions.<b> They were just not mentally equipped for those verbal duels with the Son of God. </b>Now, not wanting to go head to head with Jesus in front of a Passover crowd, <b>they conspire to attempt his capture after the crowds are cleared out of Jerusalem</b> (they were afraid of the common people)<b>. </b>Matthew and Mark both use the same Greek word (&quot;dolos&quot;) to describe the proposed method for capturing and killing Jesus - <b>&quot;TRICKERY</b>&quot; (Matthew 26:4, Mark 14:1).</p>

<p>So, here&#39;s the dilemma for these Jewish leaders. Who can we find to lead us to Jesus at a time when he is not surrounded by crowds of adoring Jews? We&#39;ll find our culprit later on in these three chapters - Judas Iscariot.</p>

<p><a name="House"></a><font size="4"><b>Supper at a leper&#39;s house (Matthew 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9)</b></font><br />
<a href="5-1.html#Supper" target="_blank" title="John 12:1-11 Summary">The detailed notes on these passages may be found in the May 1 reading which includes John 12:1-11; click here.</a><br />
Matthew and Mark have just made reference to the time in Matthew 26:2 and Mark 14:1 as being two days before the passover. While they continue their narratives into this passage, neither Matthew nor Mark declare when the supper at Simon the leper&#39;s house actually took place. In fact, we know from John 12:1 that the supper was held in Bethany four days prior to this &quot;six days before the Passover.&quot; It must be concluded, therefore, that the Matthew and Mark accounts are not following this event sequentially. All three passages regarding the event are shown below, but the detailed notes may be found in the section where we sequentially dealt with <a href="5-1.html#Supper" target="_blank" title="John 12 Summary">John 12:1-11 (see notes)</a>.</p>

<p>There had been a concern among the Jewish leadership regarding the reaction of the people to capturing Jesus. <b>Judas provides a solution when he goes to the Jewish leaders and offers to take them to Jesus away from the multitudes so that he can be taken prisoner quietly.</b> Luke 22:6 says, &quot;So he promised and sought opportunity <strong>to betray Him to them in the absence of the multitude.</strong>&quot; This is great news to the Jewish leaders. With this betrayal, they can keep the whole issue out of the news; at least that&#39;s what they thought. For those who may think that Judas somehow made his decision on some ill-conceived noble principles, think again. Look at Matthew&#39;s account in verse 15 where Judas says to the Jewish leaders, &quot;What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?&quot; <b>The only principle seen here is GREED!</b></p>

<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Feet"></a>Let&#39;s wash some feet (John 13:4-20)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">4 rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself.<br />
5 After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.<br />
6 Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, are You washing my feet?&rdquo;<br />
7 &para; Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know after this.&rdquo;<br />
8 &para; Peter said to Him, &ldquo;You shall never wash my feet!&rdquo; &para; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.&rdquo;<br />
9 &para; Simon Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!&rdquo;<br />
10 &para; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you.&rdquo;<br />
11 For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, &ldquo;You are not all clean.&rdquo;<br />
12 &para; So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, &ldquo;Do you know what I have done to you?<br />
13 You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.<br />
14 If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet.<br />
15 For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.<br />
16 Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.<br />
17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.<br />
18 &para; &ldquo;I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, &lsquo;He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.&rsquo;<br />
19 Now I tell you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe that I am He.<br />
20 Most assuredly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.&rdquo;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It&#39;s after the passover supper when Jesus does something that obviously surprises the disciples - well Peter anyway; he washes their feet.<b> It&#39;s interesting that Matthew, Mark and Luke record the institution of the Lord&#39;s supper after the passover meal, but John does not.</b> Instead, John records the event that follows afterward (foot washing), and the other three gospel authors do not. Peter finds this foot-washing ritual very unsettling. There&#39;s obviously no question here in his mind regarding the lordship of Jesus. In typical Peter style, he thinks it not appropriate for Jesus to wash his feet. On the other hand, there&#39;s Judas. We saw in this passage (verse 2) that he has already determined to betray Jesus. It is significant to note that Jesus is promoting the demonstration of humility among the disciples with this act as he says in verse 14, &quot;If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet.&quot; <b>This act takes on perspective when we recognize that the conversation about who&#39;s the greatest in Luke 22:24-30 </b>(<a href="#Greatest">see below</a>)<b> takes place at the same time. By recognizing that these two events are tied together, we see that this served as a unique lesson on humility for the disciples at that time and is not an act intended to be observed down through the ages as an ordinance like baptism and communion.</b> Both baptism and communion commemorate Jesus&#39; sacrifice (our relationship to our Lord), while the washing of feet on this occasion was for the purpose of teaching a lesson on authority to the disciples.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It occurs to me that the foot-washing episode six days earlier must have been looming in the disciples&#39; minds as this event was taking place (<a href="#House">see notes above</a>).</font></p>

<p>John&#39;s gospel gives the most detail here. Jesus proclaims to the twelve that one of them will betray him. They begin to ask among themselves who this should be. <b>Jesus clearly identifies Judas in John&#39;s gospel by giving him the word right there at the supper table.</b> This identification apparently isn&#39;t completely clear to the other disciples when Jesus sends Judas away to go about his betrayal business. We know this from John 13:28-29.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the identification of one of the disciples in verse 23, &quot;one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved,&quot; is a reference to John himself - the one who wrote this Gospel. He is clearly identified in <a href="6-30.html#John" target="_blank" title="John 21 Summary">John 21:20-25 (see notes)</a>.</p>

<p>John 13:34-35 are foundational verses for several exhortations in the epistles regarding the attitude of Believers toward one another. Notice what Jesus says here on this subject, &quot;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. <b>By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&quot;</b> Simply put, <b>Believers are to be known by the fact that they demonstrate love toward other Believers.</b></p>

<p>Here&#39;s where our ordinance began. All three synoptic gospels detail the event that followed their passover meal. However, <b>only Luke includes the words of Jesus in verse 19, &quot;...do this in remembrance of Me.&quot;</b> Paul further adds support to the continual observance of communion by believers when he says in <a href="9-6.html#Ordinance" target="_blank" title="I Corinthians 11 Summary">I Corinthians 11:26 (see notes)</a>,<b> &quot;For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death till He comes.&quot;</b> While no interval between observances is specified, it appears that the disciples in the Book of Acts observed communion on a weekly basis, and perhaps each time they met; this seems to be indicated in <a href="7-28.html#Guy" target="_blank" title="Acts 20 Summary">Acts 20:7 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Now on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul, ready to depart the next day, spoke to them and continued his message until midnight.&quot; However, there is no correct interval mandated for the observance of this ordinance.</p>

<p>Jesus declares that the bread is a picture of his body and the drink a picture of his &quot;shed&quot; blood; all three accounts make this point very clearly. Jesus makes a very clear statement regarding the covenant represented by this action - the &quot;new covenant.&quot; The Greek word for &quot;covenant&quot; here is &quot;diatheke&quot; and is interchangeably translated &quot;covenant&quot; or &quot;testament&quot; in the New Testament. It is important to recognize that the old covenant is the Mosaic Law; the new covenant is salvation by grace through the shed blood of Jesus Christ. Christians today get confused when they fail to differentiate the two.</p>

<p>Matthew (verse 30) and Mark (verse 26) report that this first communion was concluded with the singing of a hymn. It is likely that this was the singing of one of the songs found between <a href="7-17.html#Psalms" target="_blank" title="Psalms 113-118 Summary">Psalms 113-118 (see notes)</a>. Jewish tradition tells us that these were songs that were sung as part of the Passover celebration.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Greatest"></a>Who&#39;s the greatest? (Luke 22:21-30)</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">21 But behold, the hand of My betrayer is with Me on the table.<br />
22 And truly the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!&rdquo;<br />
23 &para; Then they began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.<br />
24 &para; Now there was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered the greatest.<br />
25 And He said to them, &ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called &lsquo;benefactors.&rsquo;<br />
26 But not so among you; on the contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he who governs as he who serves.<br />
27 For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.<br />
28 &para; &ldquo;But you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.<br />
29 And I bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one upon Me,<br />
30 that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&rdquo;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">As the disciples are there talking about the identity of the betrayer, they wander into a discussion about who&#39;s the greatest among them. John doesn&#39;t record this discussion, but it is interesting that the foot-washing ceremony happens at the same sitting. It is logical to assume that Jesus&#39; words, &quot;you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet&quot; (John 13:14) are spoken to emphasize the servant component rather than the leadership component of being one of Jesus&#39; disciples.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One more aspect of this is interesting. <b>John doesn&#39;t record the &quot;who&#39;s the greatest&quot; discussion, but he does record the foot washing which, I believe, is related.</b> John also doesn&#39;t record another incident which took place some time back as was recorded in <a href="4-27.html#Agent" target="_blank" title="Matthew 20, Mark 10 Summary">Matthew 20:20-28 and Mark 10:35-45 (see notes)</a>. On that occasion it was John himself and his brother, James, who sought some guarantees about their future place in the coming kingdom. They even used their mama as their agent on that occasion. Jesus used that occasion to emphasize &quot;serving&quot; as the essential quality of a disciple back then as well. Incidentally, on that occasion the other disciples were &quot;greatly displeased with the two brothers.&quot; </font></p>

<p>This competition for ruling supremacy among the twelve had a basis in Jesus&#39; previous teaching. Jesus said in <a href="4-23.html#Reward" target="_blank" title="Matthew 19 Summary">Matthew 19:28 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&quot; But wait! There&#39;s more. We see the New Jerusalem which is established in Revelation 21. Look at <a href="12-31.html#Jerusalem" target="_blank" title="Revelation 21 Summary">Revelation 21:14 (see notes)</a>, &quot;And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. &quot; <strong>So, who gets to be the big man among the twelve? Well...Jesus...of course.</strong></p>
