	<p><a name="Enemy"></a>It is difficult with what is written in this Psalm to place it in a specific period of time. Some of David's Psalms beseech the Lord to strengthen David to defeat or destroy his enemies, but not so with regard to his bouts with Saul in I Samuel or his bouts with his renegade son, Absalom, in II Samuel. In the Psalms that we know to have been written on the occasion of conflicts with these two characters, David generally asks, as he does here in verse 10, &quot;Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; Let them turn back and be ashamed suddenly.&quot; He doesn't call upon God for their destruction as he does in <a href="#Destruction">Psalm 9 (see below)</a>. David just wants them to back off - go away - give up.</p>

	<p>We sing this in a chorus at church from time to time. Note that the first and last verses of the Psalm have the same phrase. The subtitle to this Psalm is, &quot;To the Chief Musician. On the instrument of Gath. A Psalm of David.&quot; The &quot;instrument of Gath&quot; is likely some sort of a stringed instrument. </p>
	<p> When the children in the temple shouted out, &quot;Hosanna to the Son of David,&quot; Jesus quoted Psalms 8:2 in <a href="11-9.html#Angel" target="_blank">Hebrews 2:6-8 (see notes)</a> Paul quotes from from Psalm 8:4-6 to demonstrate that God had intended for man to have dominion over everything on earth, but lost it. Then, in verse 9, he makes the case that only because of Jesus will the originally-prescribed order of things be set right once again. </p>

<p>The subtitle says, &quot;To the Chief Musician. To the tune of 'Death of the Son.' A Psalm of David.&quot; Some interpret the words as meaning &quot;on the death of Labben,&quot; some unknown person. Others render the word, 'on the death of the son;' i.e., of Absalom (II Samuel 18:33). Others again have taken the underlying Hebrew word to be the name of a musical instrument, or as the name of an air to which the psalm was sung.</p>
<p>We find a reference to &quot;Zion&quot; in this Psalm. This is the geographical location of Jerusalem and specifically became the place of worship during David's reign; the temple was built there. David captured this city from the Jebusites in <a title="II Samuel 5 Summary" href="6-11.html#Jerusalem" target="_blank">II Samuel 5:7 (see notes)</a>. In this Psalm we see the rewards of the righteous from God and the judgment against the wicked.</p>
<p><a name="Destruction"></a>Unlike Psalm 6, David calls for very harsh treatment against his enemies in this Psalm as he calls for their destruction. That seems to lend further evidence to the notion that David differentiated in his Psalms with regard to the nature of the enemy (<a href="#Enemy">see note on Psalm 6 above</a>). It appears that when his enemies were family or near family, he prayed that they would just go away and leave him alone; when he considered them heathen, he prayed for their destruction.</p>

<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 WHY DO YOU STAND AFAR OFF, O LORD?<br>
Why do You hide in times of trouble? <br>
2 	The wicked in his pride persecutes the poor;<br>
Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised. <br>
3 	For the wicked boasts of his heart&rsquo;s desire;<br>
He blesses the greedy and renounces the LORD. <br>
4 	The wicked in his proud countenance does not seek God;<br>
God is in none of his thoughts. <br>
5 	His ways are always prospering;<br>
Your judgments are far above, out of his sight;<br>
As for all his enemies, he sneers at them. <br>
6 	He has said in his heart, &ldquo;I shall not be moved;<br>
I shall never be in adversity.&rdquo; <br>
7 	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression;<br>
Under his tongue is trouble and iniquity. <br>
8 	He sits in the lurking places of the villages;<br>
In the secret places he murders the innocent;<br>
His eyes are secretly fixed on the helpless. <br>
9 	He lies in wait secretly, as a lion in his den;<br>
He lies in wait to catch the poor;<br>
He catches the poor when he draws him into his net. <br>
10 	So he crouches, he lies low,<br>
That the helpless may fall by his strength. <br>
11 	He has said in his heart,<br>
&ldquo;God has forgotten;<br>
He hides His face;<br>
He will never see.&rdquo; <br>
12 	Arise, O LORD!<br>
O God, lift up Your hand!<br>
Do not forget the humble. <br>
13 	Why do the wicked renounce God?<br>
He has said in his heart,<br>
&ldquo;You will not require an account.&rdquo; <br>
14 	But You have seen, for You observe trouble and grief,<br>
To repay it by Your hand.<br>
The helpless commits himself to You;<br>
You are the helper of the fatherless. <br>
15 	Break the arm of the wicked and the evil man;<br>
Seek out his wickedness until You find none. <br>
16 	The LORD is King forever and ever;<br>
The nations have perished out of His land. <br>
17 	LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble;<br>
You will prepare their heart;<br>
You will cause Your ear to hear, <br>
18 	To do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed,<br>
That the man of the earth may oppress no more. </font></p>

	<p>This unspecified Psalmist is praying to God concerning the prosperity of wicked people. He calls for action in his prayer from God beginning with verse 12. Do you ever wonder why some just won't get saved? There's your answer in verse 4, &quot;The wicked in his proud countenance does not seek God; God is in none of his thoughts.&quot; Upon hearing the presentation of the gospel message, people make a choice regarding salvation. When people respond to the convicting power of the Holy Spirit, they get saved; when they resist the convicting power of the Holy Spirit, they remain in their lost condition.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, Paul quotes from verse 7 in <a href="8-13.html#No" title="Romans 3 Summary" target="_blank">Romans 3:14 (see notes)</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This Psalm, ascribed to David in the subtitle, is parallel to <a title="Psalm 53 Summary" href="8-13.html#Judgment" target="_blank">Romans 3:10-12 (see notes)</a> as he describes the desperate state of the unregenerate man. As mentioned in the notes on Psalm 9 (<a href="#Ruler">see above</a>), Zion at the end of this Psalm is a name David prescribed for Jerusalem. It's used over 150 times in the scripture. I think verse 1 is worth memorizing for those occasions when you come across those who proclaim to be atheists, &quot;The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.' They are corrupt, They have done abominable works, There is none who does good.&quot;</p>
<p>Verse 7 in this Psalm is curious, &quot;Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD brings back the captivity of His people, Let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad.&quot; The subtitle for this Psalm assigns it to David, but the language of verse 7 sounds like it was written by someone else during the exile period after the fall of Jerusalem. Various theories have been put forth to explain this, but it seems clear to me that David was speaking prophetically. After all, do we not clearly see Messianic prophesies in several of David's Psalms? The reality of the captivity was prophesied by Moses himself hundreds of years earlier in <a title="Deuteronomy 29 Summary" href="4-16.html#Warn" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 29-30 (see notes)</a>. It should, therefore, be no surprise that David should include this prophetic statement in his writings.</p>

	<p>The subtitle to this Psalm says, &quot;Michtam of David.&quot; The word &quot;Michtam&quot; appears in the subtitles of the following Psalms: 16, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60. What does it mean? Who knows for certain? All six are psalms of lament and four of the headings have historical references to David&#146;s struggles with the Philistines (56), Saul (57, 59) and the Arameans (60). Since the word comes from a Hebrew root meaning &#147;to cover,&#148; perhaps it could mean a &#147;song of covering.&quot; Other scholars understand the term to mean an &#147;engraving,&#148; such as an inscription on a stone slab, perhaps with gold letters. This view would set apart these Psalms as special to David.</p>
	<p>Notice verse 10, &quot;For You will not leave my soul in Sheol, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.&quot; This verse is used by both Peter and Paul as Old Testament prophecies regarding the resurrection of the Messiah. Peter quotes it in <a title="Acts 2 Summary" href="7-20.html#Continues" target="_blank">Acts 13:35 (see notes)</a>.</p>

	<p>God is great; his law is perfect; may I dwell in him. Verse 1 is a good verse to memorize. It presents the universe as evidence that all of this is God's creation. Note verse 7, &quot;The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul; The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.&quot; I'm reminded of <a title="Romans 10 Summary" href="8-21.html#Mission" target="_blank">Romans 10:17 (see notes)</a> where Paul says, &quot;So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&quot; David similarly places this level of importance upon the Law of Moses as he declares it to be perfect and valuable for &quot;converting the soul.&quot; The Hebrew word for &quot;convert&quot; there is &quot;shoob&quot; which means &quot;return to the starting point.&quot; That's the value of God's word; it increases our faith and purifies our lives. The last verse of this Psalm (verse 14) says, &quot;Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight, O LORD, my strength and my Redeemer.&quot; If you're looking for a verse that suggests how Christians should conduct themselves, here's a good one.</p>

9 	You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Your anger;<br>
The LORD shall swallow them up in His wrath,<br>
And the fire shall devour them. <br>
10 	Their offspring You shall destroy from the earth,<br>
And their descendants from among the sons of men. <br>
11 	For they intended evil against You;<br>
They devised a plot which they are not able to perform.<br>
12 	Therefore You will make them turn their back;<br>
You will make ready Your arrows on Your string toward their faces. <br>
13 	Be exalted, O LORD, in Your own strength!<br>
We will sing and praise Your power. </font></p>

<p>David praises God for his protecting hand. His enemies do not have a chance. Notice the way David refers to himself in third person in these two verses: &quot;The king shall have joy in Your strength&hellip;&quot; (verse 1); &quot;For the king trusts in the LORD&hellip;&quot; (verse 7). These two verses really sum up this Psalm: Because David trusts in the Lord, he shall joy in the strength of the Lord. That concept works for Christians today as well. What about his enemies? He has just turned them over to the Lord; let God deal with them.</p>
