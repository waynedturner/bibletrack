9 And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a great name, like the name of the great men who are on the earth. <br />

16 And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />

		<p>With the prophet Nathan as the middleman, God makes some promises to David. Among those, God promises David that <b>his throne will be established forever,</b> unlike his predecessor Saul. Here's where <b>David offers to build a temple for God.</b> While the dialogue is not particularly clear in II Samuel 7, we see clearly that <b>God declines the offer</b> in I Chronicles 17. Specifically, we see in I Chronicles 17:4 that God tells Nathan, &quot;Go and tell My servant David, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: <b>'You shall not build Me a house to dwell in.'&quot;</b> We see that David's heir to the throne, Solomon, gets the go ahead on the temple in II Samuel 7:13 and I Chronicles 17:12. <b>So...why was David not permitted by God to build the temple himself? </b></p>

		<p>We must look to some other passages of scripture for additional insight regarding this temple-building project. Here's what Solomon said about the issue to a neighboring king (Hiram, King of Tyre) in <a href="7-15.html#David" title="I Chronicles 28 Summary" target="_blank">I Chronicles 28:3 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for My name, because you have been a man of war and have shed blood.'&quot; <b>It is interesting that David engaged in war to defeat the enemies of Israel and God just as he was directed to do, but that made it inappropriate in God's eyes for him to be the one to build the temple.</b> Perhaps that gives us some understanding of why the Levites, who serviced the tabernacle and temple, were designated as draft exempt per God's command.</p>
	<p>However, the good news of the eternally-established kingdom of David far surpasses the disappointment of not being allowed to build the temple himself. As a matter of fact,<b> this passage marks the establishment of the Davidic Covenant</b> - certain eternal promises made by God to David.</p>
		<p><font size="3"><b>The Davidic covenant consists of the following promises: </b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>God promised David a successor (Solomon), one who would build the temple. 
			<li>God promised to establish David's throne as a continuing family dynasty. 
			<li>His throne would be established forever, a feat made possible through Jesus Christ. 
		</ul>
		<p>There's another aspect of the Davidic Covenant that is worth considering here. David was far from a flawless man, although God does acknowledge that David was a man &quot;who followed Me with all his heart&quot; in <a href="11-17.html#Chastisement" title="Hebrews 12 Summary" target="_blank">see the notes on Hebrews 12:5-11</a>.</p>
		<p>All in all, it was a really good day for David. By the way,<b> this covenant sits at the base of virtually all our prophecies; it's the foundation for the Book of Revelation.</b></p>

		<p>So, what do you do when God promises to establish your kingdom forever?  David speaks to God in prayer expressing his gratitude for God's goodness to David and his people. <b>Incidentally, </b><a title="Psalm 89 Summary" href="6-17.html#Note" target="_blank"><b>Psalm 89</b> (see notes)</a><b> is particularly meaningful when read in light of this occasion.</b> It is also worth noting in this prayer of thanksgiving that David does not mourn God's refusal to allow him to be the one to build the temple itself. David is just thankful to God for his special considerations upon David and all of Israel.</p>
		<p>Oh...by the way...notice the frequent usage by David in this prayer of &quot;LORD God.&quot; That's really the combination of two words which are ordinarily translated &quot;Lord&quot; in English, but are distinctly different in Hebrew. When you see in all caps &quot;LORD,&quot; the Hebrew word is &quot;Jehovah&quot; (aka &quot;Yahweh&quot;). It is the unique name for the God of Israel. English Bibles consistently designate this Hebrew rendering by printing &quot;LORD&quot; in all capital letters. When all the letters are not capitalized (Lord or lords) that Hebrew word is &quot;adon(ay);&quot; this word equates to &quot;master&quot; and, in addition to its usage as a reference to God, is also used to note the authority one person has over another i.e. Genesis 18:12 when Sarah refers to Abraham as her &quot;lord.&quot; The proper rendering is determined by context. For the sake of this discussion, I should also mention the Hebrew word for &quot;God.&quot; It's  &quot;elohim;&quot; context determines to whom this Hebrew word refers - the God of Heaven or the false gods. The form of the word is plural in Hebrew, but when speaking of the one true God, the modifiers and associated verbs take on a singular form. When the modifiers and accompanying verbs are plural, it's talking about false gods.</p>
		<p>Now that we have that groundwork out of the way, let's take a look at those words in David's prayer here. Every time you see the words &quot;Lord God&quot; in this prayer, he's really using the &quot;adonai Yahweh&quot; combination. However, I guess the editors of the KJV/NKJV thought that sounded a little funny translated into English (Lord LORD), so they substituted the English word &quot;God&quot; in place of &quot;Lord&quot; in this passage. Usually, God is derived from the Hebrew word &quot;Elohim.&quot;</p>
