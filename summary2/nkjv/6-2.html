	<p><strong>In this passage, we see the following in Jesus' ministry:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jesus is addressing the Apostles (minus Judas) on the eve of his crucifixion which began in <font size="3"><a title="John 13 Summary" href="5-25.html#Passover" target="_blank">John 13 (see notes)</a></font>.</li>
      <li>They are in Jerusalem    </li>
    </ul>
<p><font size="4"><b>So, how does this spiritual kingdom work? (John 15:1-17)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser.<br />
2 Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit.<br />
3 You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.<br />
4 Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me.<br />
5 &para; &ldquo;I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.<br />
6 If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned.<br />
7 If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.<br />
8 By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples.<br />
9 &para; &ldquo;As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.<br />
10 If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father&rsquo;s commandments and abide in His love.<br />
11 &para; &ldquo;These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.<br />
12 This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.<br />
13 Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one&rsquo;s life for his friends.<br />
14 You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.<br />
15 No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you.<br />
16 You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you.<br />
17 These things I command you, that you love one another.<br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Chapter 15 is a continuation of the discourse of <a title="John 14 Summary" href="5-25.html#Passover" target="_blank">John 13 (see notes)</a>. Jesus has been talking about individual entry into the spiritual kingdom i.e. personal salvation. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Now, specifically, h</font>ere's how this spiritual kingdom operates. Jesus is the vine; God is the vine dresser (verse 1). Verse 2 begins, &quot;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away.&quot; I'm convinced that this speaks of the disobedient, unprofitable Believer whose physical life is cut prematurely short because of continued disobedience. Such is the case with the disobedient Believers in Corinth referenced in <a title="I Corinthians 11 Summary" href="9-6.html#Deaths" target="_blank">I Corinthians 11:30 (see notes)</a>. Verse 2 continues, &quot;...and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit.&quot; This purging or pruning of verse 2 is undoubtedly the maturing <a title="Trial, Testing and Temptation" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Trial.html" target="_blank">process of trial (see notes)</a> that obedient Believers undergo in the process of living the Christian life. The Word of God is the pruning instrument. </p>
<p>Verse 3 is a universal statement of fact with regard to the purifying effect of God's Word on Believers. <b>It's simple: Staying in God's Word makes one spiritually clean and strong.</b> Verses 4-5 indicate that our entire success as Believers rests upon the empowerment of Jesus Christ through the cleansing effect of the Word of God in verse 3. In other Words, one cannot &quot;abide&quot; (verses 4-5) without the continual cleansing effect of the Word. </p>
<p><strong>Verse 6 is a little difficult. Jesus may be presenting one of three scenarios: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scenario #1:</strong> The unregenerate have no part in Christ. Thus, the fire there would be understood as Hell. </li>
  <li><strong>Scenario #2:</strong> Those who were in the vine but ceased to bear fruit were overtaken by &quot;men&quot; and lost their public testimony. In the second case, the fire would not be understood as Hell. Since the word &quot;abide&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;meno&quot; which means &quot;to remain in the same state,&quot; this scenario is a strong contender.</li>
  <li><strong>Scenario #3:</strong> Jesus is talking about Judas in this verse. After all, this is the very night Judas betrayed Jesus...and is doing so at the very time that Jesus is making this presentation. If this scenario is the correct one, then the usage of the Greek word &quot;meno&quot; speaks of Judas failing to &quot;remain&quot; with Jesus. Since Jesus identified Judas as diabolical early in his earthly ministry (<a href="3-10.html#Watch" title="John 6 Summary" target="_blank">John 6:70, see notes</a>), we know that Judas was never spiritually abiding in Christ...only physically accompanying him. If Jesus is talking about Judas here, then the fire is a reference to Hell. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In order to assist the student in making an informed decision regarding this verse 6, following is a word-for-word Greek-to-English substitution for the words of this verse:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;If a certain one might not remain in me,&quot; <em><br>
    [As an aorist subjunctive, it could be &quot;If a certain one might not have remained in me,&quot;]</em><br>
  &quot;he [she, it] was cast out [without] as the branch,&quot; <em><br>
  [This is an aorist passive verb meaning the action was performed on the subject at a point in time.]</em><br>
  &quot;and he [she, it] was dried up,&quot; <em><br>
  [This is another aorist passive verb meaning the action was performed on the subject at a point in time.]</em><br>
  &quot;and they gather the same, and into fire they cast,&quot; <em><br>
  [Both of these verbs are present active indicative third person plural in form, indicating continuous, present action.]</em><br>
  &quot;and he [she, it] is being burned.&quot; <em><br>
  [This verb is a present passive indicating that a continuous present action is being performed on the subject.]</em></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to me that the Greek aorist tense is used in the verse up to the words &quot;dried up,&quot; but the present tense is used for the balance of the verse. While the Greek aorist indicates a point in time (usually past tense) rather than continuing action (present tense), the tense change is curious. That would seem to lend credibility to scenario #3 as listed above. Maybe Jesus is addressing the Judas-betrayal issue.</p>
<p>Verses 7-8 indicate that the natural process of the Believer is to bear fruit. <b>But what is this fruit?</b> This fruit is obviously the fruit of the Spirit found in <a title="Galatians 5 Summary" href="9-30.html#Key" target="_blank">Galatians 5:22-23 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.&quot; That's the kind of fruit we expect a Believer to bear. The Greek word (phero) in this passage is found in verses 2,4,5,8 and 16. Therefore, the &quot;bear fruit&quot; of <b>verse 16 cannot refer to winning people to Christ as some have taught. </b>Jesus would not have changed definitions of the same word within the context of the same discourse.<b> </b>Instead, it refers to the manifestation of the fruit of the Spirit in Believers' everyday lives.</p>
<p>Notice the emphasis on brotherly love Jesus makes in verses 11-17. Here's the reality: When the Holy Spirit is working in Believers' lives, it's because they are abiding in Christ through the cleansing of the Word of God and subsequently being led by the Holy Spirit. Since the leadership of the Holy Spirit manifests itself in love (<a title="Galatians 5 Summary" href="5-25.html#Betrayer" title="John 13 Summary" target="_blank">John 13:34-35 (see notes)</a>, &quot; A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&quot; There, a few minutes earlier, he cites brotherly love as the commandment he makes reference to in John 15:10, &quot;If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father&rsquo;s commandments and abide in His love.&quot; So...the first attribute of Holy Spirit leadership listed in Galatians 5:22 is &quot;love,&quot; which just happens to be the commandment of John 15:10 and John 13:34-35.  </p>
<p><a name="Appreciate"></a><font size="4"><b>But everyone is not going to appreciate you (John 15:18-27)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">18 &para; &ldquo;If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you.<br />
19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.<br />
20 Remember the word that I said to you, &ldquo;A servant is not greater than his master.&rsquo; If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also.<br />
21 But all these things they will do to you for My name&rsquo;s sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me.<br />
22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.<br />
23 He who hates Me hates My Father also.<br />
24 If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would have no sin; but now they have seen and also hated both Me and My Father.<br />
25 But this happened that the word might be fulfilled which is written in their law, &ldquo;They hated Me without a cause.&rsquo;<br />
26 &para; &ldquo;But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of Me.<br />
27 And you also will bear witness, because you have been with Me from the beginning.<br />
  </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>The world hated Christ; they will hate his followers as well. Understand this; the world today ridicules Christ and Christians. When Believers stand up for their principles, the world order of our day (and Jesus' day) does everything it can to discredit us. Jesus quotes from <a title="Psalm 69 Summary" href="12-3.html#Love" target="_blank">I John 3:13 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you.&quot;</p>
	<p> It's clear: Taking an uncompromising stand for the principles of Jesus Christ will draw fire from the established world order - in Jesus' day and ours. Whenever you find someone living for Christ 24/7, he is usually categorized as a religious fanatic! And the religious-form-over-substance people take offense. People, for the most part, want just enough religious activity in their lives to relieve some guilt, but that&#146;s the extent of it. When they see someone who takes his Christian lifestyle seriously, the sense of guilt they feel often causes them to want to characterize the normal as abnormal.</p>
	<p>What about those religions that proclaim a love for God at the exclusion of Jesus Christ? Notice verse 23, &quot;He who hates Me hates My Father also.&quot; That's consistent with the words of Jesus earlier that same evening in John 14:6, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.&quot; It's definitely a package deal; <b>there is no favor with God without the acknowledgement of Jesus Christ as one's Savior.</b> </p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Jesus puts his comments into perspective (John 16:1-4)</b></font></p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;These things I have spoken to you, that you should not be made to stumble.<br />
2 They will put you out of the synagogues; yes, the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that he offers God service.<br />
3 And these things they will do to you because they have not known the Father nor Me.<br />
4 But these things I have told you, that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you of them. &para; &ldquo;And these things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you.<br />
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><font size="3">Chapter 16 is a continuation of the discourse of <a title="John 14 Summary" href="5-29.html#Crucifixion" target="_blank">John 14 (see notes)</a>.</font> This theme regarding the world's disdain for our faith continues from the end of chapter 15. Don't be caught by surprise when the world does not warm up to your walk with Christ. What might one expect? Notice these sobering words in verse 2, &quot;They will put you out of the synagogues; yes, the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that he offers God service.&quot; Let's face it - Believers who &quot;abide&quot; in Christ are just never going to be very popular with the worldly crowd.</p>
	<p>Earlier in this discourse, Jesus referenced the Holy Spirit as the &quot;Helper&quot; that would soon come in <a title="John 14 Summary" href="5-29.html#Help" target="_blank">John 14:16, 26 (see notes)</a>. He mentions it again here in verse 26 (<a href="#Prayer">see below</a>) in the context that the Holy Spirit will bring us help/comfort when Believers are hated by the world. Jesus will elaborate additionally in John 16:7 (<a href="#Go">see below</a>).</p>
<p><a name="Go"></a><font size="4"><b>I must go that he might come (John 16:5-22)<br>

6 But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.<br />
7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.<br />
8 And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:<br />
9 of sin, because they do not believe in Me;<br />
10 of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;<br />
11 of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.<br />
12 &para; &ldquo;I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.<br />
13 However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come.<br />
14 He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.<br />
15 All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you.<br />
16 &para; &ldquo;A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I go to the Father.&rdquo;<br />
17 &para; Then some of His disciples said among themselves, &ldquo;What is this that He says to us, &ldquo;A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;because I go to the Father&rsquo; ?&rdquo;<br />
18 They said therefore, &ldquo;What is this that He says, &lsquo;A little while&rsquo;? We do not know what He is saying.&rdquo; <br />
19 &para; Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to them, &ldquo;Are you inquiring among yourselves about what I said, &lsquo;A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me&rsquo;?<br />
20 Most assuredly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.<br />
21 A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world.<br />
22 Therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you.<br />

	<p><font size="3">Earlier in this discourse, Jesus had told them that he was leaving to prepare a place for them in <a title="John 14 Summary" href="8-17.html#Lives" target="_blank">Romans 8:9 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.&quot; A further benefit of the Holy Spirit's presence in Believers is spiritual understanding. Look at verse 13. He will guide Believers to understand spiritual things.</p>
	<p><b>Verses 8-11 seem a little cryptic:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>8 And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:<br />
9 of sin, because they do not believe in Me;<br />
10 of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;<br />
11 of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.<br />

	</blockquote>
	<p>Here's the sense I think we derive from these verses. The Holy Spirit comes after Jesus has ascended on the day of Pentecost (<a title="Acts 2 Summary" href="10-4.html#Faith" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:2 (see notes)</a>. </p>
	<p><b>Jesus also attributes these activities to the Holy Spirit after Jesus has ascended to Heaven:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>&quot;He will guide you into all truth&quot; (verse 13)
			<li> &quot;He will tell you things to come&quot; (verse 13)
			<li>&quot;He will glorify Me [Jesus]&quot; (verse 14)
			<li>&quot;He will take of Mine and declare it to you.&quot; (verse 15)
		</ul>
	<p><strong>It is clear that the Holy Spirit is the key to sound doctrine as well as Godly Christian living.</strong></p>
	<p>In verses 16-22 Jesus goes into some detail about his crucifixion and ascension. Verse 20 frames the discussion, &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.&quot; The disciples will be sad when Jesus is crucified, but Satan's forces will be happy. However, in the final outcome, &quot;sorrow will be turned into joy.&quot;</p>

27 for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from God.<br />

	<p>The disciples are starting to understand the necessity of the crucifixion, the physical absence of Jesus and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit that will follow. Prayer power will be experienced by anyone who prays in the name of Jesus. Many Believers are confused about what it means to pray &quot;in Jesus' name&quot; (verse 24). <a title="John 14 Summary" href="5-29.html#Revelation" target="_blank">Click here to see the notes on John 14:12-14 for a clear explanation of this concept.</a> His disciples then indicate that they are beginning to get the picture in verses 29-30. Jesus then explains to them the persecution that is upon them and prophesies that they will scatter. Verse 33 is an assurance verse for them (and us), &quot;These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Jesus offers this prayer prior to entering the Garden of Gethsemane. </b>THIS IS NOT the prayer in Gethsemane reported in the synoptic Gospels (<a title="Matthew 26:36-45; Mark 14:32-41; Luke 22:39-46; John 18:1 Summary" href="6-6.html#Jesus" target="_blank">Matthew 26:36-45; Mark 14:32-41; Luke 22:39-46; John 18:1, see notes</a>). </p>
<p><b>This prayer of Jesus is divided into three parts:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Jesus&#146; prayer concerning himself (1-5)
<br>
				Earthly ministry mission accomplished - only the crucifixion and resurrection to go to complete the transaction.<br>
				&quot;Life eternal&quot; is defined by Jesus as knowing God AND knowing Jesus Christ (verse 3).
			
				
			
			
				
						<li>Jesus' prayer for the disciples (6-19)<br>
				He prays for their deliverance from the evil assault of the near future. Judas gets dishonorable mention in verse 12 where his betrayal of Jesus is shown to be his destiny. He was not a good man who made a mistake. Jesus describes him as the &quot;son of perdition.&quot; For additional insight, <a title="John 6 Summary" href="3-10.html#Watch" target="_blank">see the notes on John 6:70.</a> <br>
				Verse 12 takes on an additional significance in <a href="6-6.html#Crowd" title="John 18 Summary" target="_blank">John 18:9 (see notes)</a>. John tells us that this was fulfilled as Jesus protected his disciples from harm at his capture.<br>
				You will also notice that Jesus prays for his followers, not that they would withdraw from the world after his departure, but they they would refrain from indulging in the world's godless activities.
									<li>Jesus' prayer for all Believers present and future (20-26)<br>
				He prays for the unity of Believers.
			
		</ul>
		<p>It is not until this prayer is finished that Jesus and his disciples enter the Garden of Gethsemane in <a title="John 18 Summary" href="6-6.html#Jesus" target="_blank">John 18:1 (see notes)</a>.</p>
		<p><b>One might ask, &quot;If Jesus is God, why did he pray?&quot; The answer is to be found in </b><a title="Philippians 2 Summary" href="10-12.html#Emulate" target="_blank"><b>Philippians 2:5-8 </b>(see notes)</a><b>:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>5 Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, <br>
			  6 who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, <br>
			  7 but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. <br>
		    8 And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Jesus took &quot;the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.&quot; That was the mortal state of Jesus at the time of this prayer and leading up to his crucifixion. At that point in time, he communicated with God in prayer just as we do.</p>
	<p><b>In his prayer, Jesus declares in verses 17-19 that we, as Believers, are sanctified (set apart) through the cleansing of the Word of God. Thus, we are sanctified by the truth of the Word of God because Jesus sanctified </b>(Greek: &quot;hagiazo&quot; means &quot;set apart&quot;)<b> himself for the crucifixion.</b> It is vitally important that Believers understand the value of embracing and studying God's Word (the Bible) as a regular routine in their Christian walk. <b>Strong Believers spend regular time daily reading and studying God's Word.</b> And...that's why I'm committed to providing this commentary to all Believers everywhere.</p>
