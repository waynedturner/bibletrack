<p><em>A review of where the Levites lived within the Tribes of Israel </em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="2">54 &para; Now these are their dwelling places throughout their settlements in their territory, for they were given by lot to the sons of Aaron, of the family of the Kohathites: <br />
55 They gave them Hebron in the land of Judah, with its surrounding common-lands. <br />
56 But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh. <br />
57 And to the sons of Aaron they gave one of the cities of refuge, Hebron; also Libnah with its common-lands, Jattir, Eshtemoa with its common-lands, <br />
58 Hilen with its common-lands, Debir with its common-lands, <br />
59 Ashan with its common-lands, and Beth Shemesh with its common-lands. <br />
60 And from the tribe of Benjamin: Geba with its common-lands, Alemeth with its common-lands, and Anathoth with its common-lands. All their cities among their families were thirteen. <br />
61 &para; To the rest of the family of the tribe of the Kohathites they gave by lot ten cities from half the tribe of Manasseh. <br />
62 And to the sons of Gershon, throughout their families, they gave thirteen cities from the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. <br />
63 To the sons of Merari, throughout their families, they gave twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben, from the tribe of Gad, and from the tribe of Zebulun. <br />
64 So the children of Israel gave these cities with their common-lands to the Levites. <br />
65 And they gave by lot from the tribe of the children of Judah, from the tribe of the children of Simeon, and from the tribe of the children of Benjamin these cities which are called by their names. <br />
66 &para; Now some of the families of the sons of Kohath were given cities as their territory from the tribe of Ephraim. <br />
67 And they gave them one of the cities of refuge, Shechem with its common-lands, in the mountains of Ephraim, also Gezer with its common-lands, <br />
68 Jokmeam with its common-lands, Beth Horon with its common-lands, <br />
69 Aijalon with its common-lands, and Gath Rimmon with its common-lands. <br />
70 And from the half-tribe of Manasseh: Aner with its common-lands and Bileam with its common-lands, for the rest of the family of the sons of Kohath. <br />
71 &para; From the family of the half-tribe of Manasseh the sons of Gershon were given Golan in Bashan with its common-lands and Ashtaroth with its common-lands. <br />
72 And from the tribe of Issachar: Kedesh with its common-lands, Daberath with its common-lands, <br />
73 Ramoth with its common-lands, and Anem with its common-lands. <br />
74 And from the tribe of Asher: Mashal with its common-lands, Abdon with its common-lands, <br />
75 Hukok with its common-lands, and Rehob with its common-lands. <br />
76 And from the tribe of Naphtali: Kedesh in Galilee with its common-lands, Hammon with its common-lands, and Kirjathaim with its common-lands. <br />
77 &para; From the tribe of Zebulun the rest of the children of Merari were given Rimmon with its common-lands and Tabor with its common-lands. <br />
78 And on the other side of the Jordan, across from Jericho, on the east side of the Jordan, they were given from the tribe of Reuben: Bezer in the wilderness with its common-lands, Jahzah with its common-lands, <br />
79 Kedemoth with its common-lands, and Mephaath with its common-lands. <br />
80 And from the tribe of Gad: Ramoth in Gilead with its common-lands, Mahanaim with its common-lands, <br />
81 Heshbon with its common-lands, and Jazer with its common-lands. </font> </p>

<p>Notice verses 31-46. David appointed Levites to serve as music directors. We are told by historians that it was typical in the ancient world for the various religions to have an entire order of musicians dedicated to worship. It's noteworthy that worship has traditionally been accompanied by music. David himself appointed an entire music team to head up this aspect of worship. The three leading musicians Heman, Asaph and Ethan were appointed, one from each of the Levite families (33, 39, 44).</p>
<p><a name="Zadok"></a><b>We also notice in this chapter that not all Levites were created equal. Those who were descendants of Aaron were authorized to offer sacrifices, but the rest were in charge of other tabernacle and temple duties.</b> The genealogy for the priests in verses 3-15 goes from Aaron through Eleazar all the way down to the return of the exiles; this genealogy does not include the priests from Aaron's other son, Ithamar. As a matter of fact, Eli (priest during the first four chapters of I Samuel) was a descendant of Ithamar, and so was Ahimelech and his son Abiathar during the reigns of Saul and David. In David's day, the high priest was a man named <b>Zadok</b> (listed here in 8 and 53) along with Abiathar. Abiathar continued on into Solomon's rule until he was removed by Solomon in<a title="I Kings 2 Summary" href="3-27.html#Women" target="_blank">Numbers 25:12-13 (see notes)</a>, future priests should all come only from the line of Phinehas and not Ithamar. Obviously, it took a few generations for this to become reality, but was finally set in order with the end of Abiathar's priesthood by Solomon. You will notice that the high priesthood of Eli through Abiathar are not recognized in this genealogical record.</p>
		<p>It makes sense, therefore, that only the line of Aaron through Eleazar is listed here in this genealogy of priests. <b>All high priests of Israel from Zadok forward claimed to be his descendant.</b> In New Testament times, the Sadducees served as the priestly class. &quot;Sadducee&quot; is a word that is believed to be derived from &quot;Zadok.&quot; That fits what we know of New Testament history; the high priests claimed to be descendants of Zadok, and therefore all the high priests were Sadducees. It's ironic that the Sadducees of the New Testament had a common trait: they did not believe in the supernatural including life after death, resurrection of the dead, etc.</p>
		<p>Beginning in verse 54 through the end of the chapter we have a listing of the 48 cities occupied by the Levites, a repeat of <a title="Joshua 21 Summary" href="4-26.html#Levites" target="_blank">Joshua 21 (see notes)</a>.</p>
