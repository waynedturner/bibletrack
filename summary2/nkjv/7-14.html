<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">A Song of Ascents. Of David. <br />
1 &para; 	LORD, my heart is not haughty,<br />
Nor my eyes lofty.<br />
Neither do I concern myself with great matters,<br />
Nor with things too profound for me. <br />
2 	Surely I have calmed and quieted my soul,<br />
Like a weaned child with his mother;<br />
Like a weaned child is my soul within me. <br />
3 	O Israel, hope in the LORD<br />
From this time forth and forever. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Here's
  a very short Psalm written by David. The introduction to this Psalm
  says &quot;Song of Ascents.&quot; The KJV says &quot;Song of Degrees.&quot; Here's the entry from Easton's Bible Dictionary
  regarding the meaning of this introduction:</font></p>
<blockquote>
			<p><font size="3"><b>Song of Degrees:</b>
song of steps, a title given to each of these fifteen psalms, 120&#8211;134
inclusive. The probable origin of this name is the circumstance that
these psalms came to be sung by the people on the ascents or goings up
to Jerusalem to attend the three great festivals (Deut. 16:16). They
were well fitted for being sung by the way from their peculiar form,
and from the sentiments they express. &#8220;They are characterized by
brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora [i.e., repetition], and by their
epigrammatic style...More than half of them are cheerful, and all of
them hopeful.&#8221; They are sometimes called &#8220;Pilgrim Songs.&#8221; Four of them
were written by David, one (127) by Solomon, and the rest are anonymous.</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><font size="3">David
uses an interesting simile here in these verses. He is content in the
Lord just as a recently-fed baby in the presence of his mother - no
fretting over sustenance - just contented fellowship.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>A Psalm of thanks (Psalm 138)<br>
	</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">A Psalm of David. <br />
1 &para; 	I will praise You with my whole heart;<br />
Before the gods I will sing praises to You. <br />
2 	I will worship toward Your holy temple,<br />
And praise Your name<br />
For Your lovingkindness and Your truth;<br />
For You have magnified Your word above all Your name. <br />
3 	In the day when I cried out, You answered me,<br />
And made me bold with strength in my soul. <br />
4 	All the kings of the earth shall praise You, O LORD,<br />
When they hear the words of Your mouth. <br />
5 	Yes, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD,<br />
For great is the glory of the LORD. <br />
6 	Though the LORD is on high,<br />
Yet He regards the lowly;<br />
But the proud He knows from afar. <br />
7 	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me;<br />
You will stretch out Your hand<br />
Against the wrath of my enemies,<br />
And Your right hand will save me. <br />
8 	The LORD will perfect that which concerns me;<br />
Your mercy, O LORD, endures forever;<br />
Do not forsake the works of Your hands. <br />
		  </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>You
		  will notice in this Psalm of David a declaration of thanks, his reasons
		  for thanks, a call to praise, and his expression of confidence in God.
		  David was surrounded by nations that were polytheistic. He proclaims in
		  verse 1, "I will praise You with my whole heart; <strong>Before the gods</strong> I will sing praises to You." He makes it clear that he'll not
		  compromise the worship of the true God for political correctness. As a
		  matter of fact, his world view is almost prophetic when he asserts in verse 4,
  "<strong>All the kings of the earth shall praise You</strong>, O LORD, When they hear the words of Your mouth." He's convinced that there's coming a day
		  when they'll acknowledge the one true God as well. That gives this
		  Psalm a little of that Messianic Kingdom flavor.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>A personal relationship with God (Psalm 139)<br>
	</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. <br />
1 &para; 	O LORD, You have searched me and known me.<br />
2 	You know my sitting down and my rising up;<br />
You understand my thought afar off. <br />
3 	You comprehend my path and my lying down,<br />
And are acquainted with all my ways. <br />
4 	For there is not a word on my tongue,<br />
But behold, O LORD, You know it altogether. <br />
5 	You have hedged me behind and before,<br />
And laid Your hand upon me. <br />
6 	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;<br />
It is high, I cannot attain it. <br />
7 	Where can I go from Your Spirit?<br />
Or where can I flee from Your presence? <br />
8 	If I ascend into heaven, You are there;<br />
If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there.<br />
9 	If I take the wings of the morning,<br />
And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, <br />
10 	Even there Your hand shall lead me,<br />
And Your right hand shall hold me. <br />
11 	If I say, &ldquo;Surely the darkness shall fall on me,&rdquo;<br />
Even the night shall be light about me; <br />
12 	Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You,<br />
But the night shines as the day;<br />
The darkness and the light are both alike to You.<br />
13 	For You formed my inward parts;<br />
You covered me in my mother&rsquo;s womb. <br />
14 	I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made;<br />
Marvelous are Your works,<br />
And that my soul knows very well. <br />
15 	My frame was not hidden from You,<br />
When I was made in secret,<br />
And skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. <br />
16 	Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed.<br />
And in Your book they all were written,<br />
The days fashioned for me,<br />
When as yet there were none of them. <br />
17 	How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God!<br />
How great is the sum of them! <br />
18 	If I should count them, they would be more in number than the sand;<br />
When I awake, I am still with You. <br />
19 	Oh, that You would slay the wicked, O God!<br />
Depart from me, therefore, you bloodthirsty men. <br />
20 	For they speak against You wickedly;<br />
Your enemies take Your name in vain. <br />
21 	Do I not hate them, O LORD, who hate You?<br />
And do I not loathe those who rise up against You? <br />
22 	I hate them with perfect hatred;<br />
I count them my enemies. <br />
23 	Search me, O God, and know my heart;<br />
Try me, and know my anxieties; <br />
24 	And see if there is any wicked way in me,<br />
And lead me in the way everlasting. </font></p>

<p>David's
  Psalm reveals how very personal his relationship with God is. David
  displays the intense interest God has in every aspect of the lives of
  his people. And when did God begin to display this interest in David's
  life? There's the answer in verse 13, "For You formed my inward parts; You covered me<b> in my mother&rsquo;s womb.</b>" Let's face it, <b>David was certain that his life began in his mother's womb.<br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>Notice four attributes of God listed here by David:<br>
</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>God's omniscience (verses 1-6)</li>
  <li>God's omnipresence (verses 7-12)</li>
  <li>God's omnipotence as seen in the formation of man (verses 13-18)</li>
  <li>God's holiness, which destroys evil men and searches the Believer&#8217;s heart (verses 19-24)</li>
  </ul>

	<p>I find verses 21-22 particularly interesting here: &quot;Do I not hate them, O LORD, who hate You? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?  I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them my enemies.&quot; Ouch! That's not very politically correct in today's Christian circles. The Hebrew word there for &quot;perfect&quot; means &quot;complete/thorough.&quot; Hey! I don't make the news, I just report it. And...that's what David himself wrote in this Psalm with regard to his attitude toward those who have set themselves against God.<br>
      </p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Deliver me from my enemies (Psalm 143)<br>
	</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">A Psalm of David. <br />
1 &para; 	Hear my prayer, O LORD,<br />
Give ear to my supplications!<br />
In Your faithfulness answer me,<br />
And in Your righteousness. <br />
2 	Do not enter into judgment with Your servant,<br />
For in Your sight no one living is righteous. <br />
3 	For the enemy has persecuted my soul;<br />
He has crushed my life to the ground;<br />
He has made me dwell in darkness,<br />
Like those who have long been dead. <br />
4 	Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me;<br />
My heart within me is distressed. <br />
5 	I remember the days of old;<br />
I meditate on all Your works;<br />
I muse on the work of Your hands. <br />
6 	I spread out my hands to You;<br />
My soul longs for You like a thirsty land.<br />
Selah<br />
7 	Answer me speedily, O LORD;<br />
My spirit fails!<br />
Do not hide Your face from me,<br />
Lest I be like those who go down into the pit. <br />
8 	Cause me to hear Your lovingkindness in the morning,<br />
For in You do I trust;<br />
Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,<br />
For I lift up my soul to You. <br />
9 	Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies;<br />
In You I take shelter. <br />
10 	Teach me to do Your will,<br />
For You are my God;<br />
Your Spirit is good.<br />
Lead me in the land of uprightness. <br />
11 	Revive me, O LORD, for Your name&rsquo;s sake!<br />
For Your righteousness&rsquo; sake bring my soul out of trouble. <br />
12 	In Your mercy cut off my enemies,<br />
And destroy all those who afflict my soul;<br />
For I am Your servant. <br />

<p>David
  was waxing very poetic when he wrote this one. This is an acrostic
  Psalm like Psalm 119 (but much shorter). Each verse begins with the
  next letter of the Hebrew alphabet. There is one deviation from this
  acrostic style - no "nun," the equivalent to our letter "n." Without
  Hebrew manuscript evidence to do so, the NIV and the New Living
  Translation add a verse for this letter of the Hebrew alphabet and
  append the verse to the end of verse 13. Their reasoning for doing so apparently lies in its entry into the Greek Septuagint and a recent discovery of its presence in one of the documents discovered among the Dead Sea scrolls. Of the commonly used
  translations today, no other Bible translation with which I am familiar
  makes any attempt to enter it into the text with such weak textual evidence. This Psalm is all about praising
  God.</p>
