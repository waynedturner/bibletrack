	<p><b><font size="4">Without a particular theme, I have noted some particularly meaningful and applicable proverbs from these three chapters.</font></b></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Who are you hangin' with? (Proverbs 13)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 A wise son heeds his father&rsquo;s instruction,<br />
But a scoffer does not listen to rebuke. <br />
2 	A man shall eat well by the fruit of his mouth,<br />
But the soul of the unfaithful feeds on violence. <br />
3 	He who guards his mouth preserves his life,<br />
But he who opens wide his lips shall have destruction. <br />
4 	The soul of a lazy man desires, and has nothing;<br />
But the soul of the diligent shall be made rich. <br />
5 	A righteous man hates lying,<br />
But a wicked man is loathsome and comes to shame. <br />
6 	Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless,<br />
But wickedness overthrows the sinner. <br />
7 	There is one who makes himself rich, yet has nothing;<br />
And one who makes himself poor, yet has great riches. <br />
8 	The ransom of a man&rsquo;s life is his riches,<br />
But the poor does not hear rebuke. <br />
9 	The light of the righteous rejoices,<br />
But the lamp of the wicked will be put out. <br />
10 	By pride comes nothing but strife,<br />
But with the well-advised is wisdom. <br />
11 	Wealth gained by dishonesty will be diminished,<br />
But he who gathers by labor will increase. <br />
12 	Hope deferred makes the heart sick,<br />
But when the desire comes,  it is a tree of life. <br />
13 	He who despises the word will be destroyed,<br />
But he who fears the commandment will be rewarded. <br />
14 	The law of the wise is a fountain of life,<br />
To turn one away from the snares of death. <br />
15 	Good understanding gains favor,<br />
But the way of the unfaithful is hard. <br />
16 	Every prudent man acts with knowledge,<br />
But a fool lays open his folly. <br />
17 	A wicked messenger falls into trouble,<br />
But a faithful ambassador brings health. <br />
18 	Poverty and shame will come to him who disdains correction,<br />
But he who regards a rebuke will be honored. <br />
19 	A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul,<br />
But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil. <br />
20 	He who walks with wise men will be wise,<br />
But the companion of fools will be destroyed. <br />
21 	Evil pursues sinners,<br />
But to the righteous, good shall be repaid. <br />
22 	A good man leaves an inheritance to his children&rsquo;s children,<br />
But the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous. <br />
23 	Much food is in the fallow ground of the poor,<br />
And for lack of justice there is waste. <br />
24 	He who spares his rod hates his son,<br />
But he who loves him disciplines him promptly. <br />
25 	The righteous eats to the satisfying of his soul,<br />
But the stomach of the wicked shall be in want. <br />

<p><b>Sometimes you can just talk too much.<br>
		</b>Proverbs 13:3 He who guards his mouth preserves his life, But he who opens wide his lips shall have destruction. <br>
			<b>Here's a summary of Solomon's welfare program in Israel.<br>
			</b>Proverbs 13:4 The soul of a lazy man desires, and has nothing; But the soul of the diligent shall be made rich. <br>
			<b>Take care regarding those you hang with; it classifies you.<br>
			</b>Proverbs 13:20 He who walks with wise men will be wise, But the companion of fools will be destroyed. <br>
			<b>Turning your back on God is a serious mistake.<br>
			</b>Proverbs 13:13 He who despises the word will be destroyed, But he who fears the commandment will be rewarded. <br>
			<b>The importance of child discipline.<br>
			</b>Proverbs 13:24 He who spares his rod hates his son, But he who loves him disciplines him promptly. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 The wise woman builds her house,<br />
But the foolish pulls it down with her hands. <br />
2 	He who walks in his uprightness fears the LORD,<br />
But he who is perverse in his ways despises Him. <br />
3 	In the mouth of a fool is a rod of pride,<br />
But the lips of the wise will preserve them. <br />
4 	Where no oxen are, the trough is clean;<br />
But much increase comes by the strength of an ox. <br />
5 	A faithful witness does not lie,<br />
But a false witness will utter lies. <br />
6 	A scoffer seeks wisdom and does not find it,<br />
But knowledge is easy to him who understands. <br />
7 	Go from the presence of a foolish man,<br />
When you do not perceive in him the lips of knowledge. <br />
8 	The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way,<br />
But the folly of fools is deceit. <br />
9 	Fools mock at sin,<br />
But among the upright there is favor. <br />
10 	The heart knows its own bitterness,<br />
And a stranger does not share its joy. <br />
11 	The house of the wicked will be overthrown,<br />
But the tent of the upright will flourish. <br />
12 	There is a way that seems right to a man,<br />
But its end is the way of death. <br />
13 	Even in laughter the heart may sorrow,<br />
And the end of mirth may be grief. <br />
14 	The backslider in heart will be filled with his own ways,<br />
But a good man will be satisfied from above. <br />
15 	The simple believes every word,<br />
But the prudent considers well his steps. <br />
16 	A wise man fears and departs from evil,<br />
But a fool rages and is self-confident. <br />
17 	A quick-tempered man acts foolishly,<br />
And a man of wicked intentions is hated. <br />
18 	The simple inherit folly,<br />
But the prudent are crowned with knowledge. <br />
19 	The evil will bow before the good,<br />
And the wicked at the gates of the righteous. <br />
20 	The poor man is hated even by his own neighbor,<br />
But the rich has many friends. <br />
21 	He who despises his neighbor sins;<br />
But he who has mercy on the poor, happy is he. <br />
22 	Do they not go astray who devise evil?<br />
But mercy and truth belong to those who devise good. <br />
23 	In all labor there is profit,<br />
But idle chatter leads only to poverty. <br />
24 	The crown of the wise is their riches,<br />
But the foolishness of fools is folly. <br />
25 	A true witness delivers souls,<br />
But a deceitful witness speaks lies. <br />
26 	In the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence,<br />
And His children will have a place of refuge. <br />
27 	The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life,<br />
To turn one away from the snares of death. <br />
28 	In a multitude of people is a king&rsquo;s honor,<br />
But in the lack of people is the downfall of a prince. <br />
29 	He who is slow to wrath has great understanding,<br />
But he who is impulsive exalts folly. <br />
30 	A sound heart is life to the body,<br />
But envy is rottenness to the bones. <br />
31 	He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker,<br />
But he who honors Him has mercy on the needy. <br />
32 	The wicked is banished in his wickedness,<br />
But the righteous has a refuge in his death. <br />
33 	Wisdom rests in the heart of him who has understanding,<br />
But what is in the heart of fools is made known. <br />
34 	Righteousness exalts a nation,<br />
But sin is a reproach to any people. <br />
35 	The king&rsquo;s favor is toward a wise servant,<br />
But his wrath is against him who causes shame. <br />

<p><b>Hey! A well used workplace is going to be messy!<br>
  </b>Proverbs 14:4 Where no oxen are, the trough is clean; But much increase comes by the strength of an ox. <br>

			</b>Proverbs 14:9 Fools mock at sin, But among the upright there is favor. <br>

			Proverbs 14:12 There is a way that seems right to a man, But its end is the way of death.<br>

		  Proverbs 14:15 The simple believes every word, But the prudent considers well his steps.<br>
		    <b>Watch that temper!<br>
	        </b>Proverbs 14:17 A quick-tempered man acts foolishly, And a man of wicked intentions is hated. <b><br>

<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="2">1 A soft answer turns away wrath,<br />
But a harsh word stirs up anger. <br />
2 	The tongue of the wise uses knowledge rightly,<br />
But the mouth of fools pours forth foolishness. <br />
3 	The eyes of the LORD are in every place,<br />
Keeping watch on the evil and the good. <br />
4 	A wholesome tongue is a tree of life,<br />
But perverseness in it breaks the spirit. <br />
5 	A fool despises his father&rsquo;s instruction,<br />
But he who receives correction is prudent. <br />
6 	In the house of the righteous  there is much treasure,<br />
But in the revenue of the wicked is trouble. <br />
7 	The lips of the wise disperse knowledge,<br />
But the heart of the fool does not  do so. <br />
8 	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD,<br />
But the prayer of the upright is His delight. <br />
9 	The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD,<br />
But He loves him who follows righteousness. <br />
10 	Harsh discipline is for him who forsakes the way,<br />
And he who hates correction will die. <br />
11 	Hell and Destruction are before the LORD;<br />
So how much more the hearts of the sons of men. <br />
12 	A scoffer does not love one who corrects him,<br />
Nor will he go to the wise. <br />
13 	A merry heart makes a cheerful countenance,<br />
But by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. <br />
14 	The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge,<br />
But the mouth of fools feeds on foolishness. <br />
15 	All the days of the afflicted are evil,<br />
But he who is of a merry heart has a continual feast. <br />
16 	Better is a little with the fear of the LORD,<br />
Than great treasure with trouble. <br />
17 	Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,<br />
Than a fatted calf with hatred. <br />
18 	A wrathful man stirs up strife,<br />
But he who is slow to anger allays contention. <br />
19 	The way of the lazy man is like a hedge of thorns,<br />
But the way of the upright is a highway. <br />
20 	A wise son makes a father glad,<br />
But a foolish man despises his mother. <br />
21 	Folly is joy to him who is destitute of discernment,<br />
But a man of understanding walks uprightly. <br />
22 	Without counsel, plans go awry,<br />
But in the multitude of counselors they are established. <br />
23 	A man has joy by the answer of his mouth,<br />
And a word spoken in due season, how good it is!<br />
24 	The way of life winds upward for the wise,<br />
That he may turn away from hell below. <br />
25 	The LORD will destroy the house of the proud,<br />
But He will establish the boundary of the widow. <br />
26 	The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD,<br />
But the words of the pure are pleasant. <br />
27 	He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house,<br />
But he who hates bribes will live. <br />
28 	The heart of the righteous studies how to answer,<br />
But the mouth of the wicked pours forth evil. <br />
29 	The LORD is far from the wicked,<br />
But He hears the prayer of the righteous. <br />
30 	The light of the eyes rejoices the heart,<br />
And a good report makes the bones healthy. <br />
31 	The ear that hears the rebukes of life<br />
Will abide among the wise. <br />
32 	He who disdains instruction despises his own soul,<br />
But he who heeds rebuke gets understanding. <br />
33 	The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom,<br />
And before honor is humility. </font> </p>
