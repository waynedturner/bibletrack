              2 that the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon. <br>
              3 And the LORD said to him: &ldquo;I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built to put My name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually. <br>

              8 And as for this house, which is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss, and say, &ldquo;Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?&rsquo; <br>
            9 Then they will answer, &ldquo;Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore the LORD has brought all this calamity on them.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </font></td>

		<p>In <a href="6-19.html#Temple" target="_blank"><b>II Samuel 7:12-16</b> (see notes)</a><b>.</b> </p>
		<p>However, there was a conditional part of the promise regarding David's throne. While it will be established eternally, it may be (and was) interrupted due to the conditions in this passage i.e. <b>Israel went after other gods and forsook the one true God. </b>We'll see that during Solomon's reign, he allowed worship of false gods to come right into the temple court - apparently even promoted it. While he always highly esteemed God himself, he allowed &quot;freedom of religion&quot; to be practiced by his own wives and the residents of Israel.<b> The Lord God of Israel was not exclusive with him like he had been with his father David - a shortcoming of Solomon that turned out to be the beginning of Israel's downfall. </b>And God didn't let this lack of faithfulness slide, as is pointed out in <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="8-18.html#Solomon" target="_blank">I Kings 11:1-25 (see notes)</a>. Consequently, after his reign was over, Israel split; the northern 10 tribes went after the worship of false gods. </p>
	<p><strong>Let's take a closer look at the negative stipulations found in I Kings 9:6-9:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
			<p>6 But if you or your sons at all turn from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, <br>
7 then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight. Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples. <br>
8 And as for this house, which is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss, and say, &ldquo;Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?&rsquo; <br>
9 Then they will answer, &ldquo;Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore the LORD has brought all this calamity on them.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>So...it is important to recognize that, while <b>God is bound to honor the Davidic Covenant</b> first established in <a title="II Samuel 7 Summary" href="6-19.html#Temple" target="_blank">II Samuel 7:12-16 (see notes)</a>, this covenant did not prevent the setback brought about by the people of Israel going after false gods (per the conditions of the warning of this passage). In 586 B.C. the last stronghold of Israel, the city of Jerusalem, fell to the Babylonians; from that time until Israel declared its independence in 1948, there was no autonomous nation called Israel. </p>
		<p>In October, 2004, a modern (unofficial) Sanhedrin was established in Israel patterned after that with which we are familiar from the New Testament. In addition, there is a keen interest among these religious leaders (the revived Sanhedrin) to restore the Davidic monarchy. Orthodox Jews see this as the path toward restoration i.e. the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy regarding the Davidic Kingdom. <a href="http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/index.php/The_Re-established_Jewish_Sanhedrin" title="Sanhedrin" target="_blank">The website for the new Sanhedrin may be viewed by clicking here.</a></p>
	<p>Most fundamental Christian Bible scholars today see the situation differently. I share their view that it is incidental to Old Testament prophetic promises whether or not the temple or the Davidic throne is established prior to the 70th week of Daniel (<a title="Daniel 9 Summary" href="12-3.html#Temple" target="_blank">Ezekiel 40, see notes</a>). In Ezekiel 40-48 we see detailed information regarding the rebuilding of this millennium temple.</p>

            11 (Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress and gold, as much as he desired), that King Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. <br>
            12 Then Hiram went from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, but they did not please him. <br>
            13 So he said, &ldquo;What kind of cities are these which you have given me, my brother?&rdquo; And he called them the land of Cabul, as they are to this day. <br>
            14 Then Hiram sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold. <br>
            15 &para; And this is the reason for the labor force which King Solomon raised: to build the house of the LORD, his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. <br>
            16 (Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire, had killed the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon&rsquo;s wife.) <br>
            17 And Solomon built Gezer, Lower Beth Horon, <br>
            18 Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,<br>
            19 all the storage cities that Solomon had, cities for his chariots and cities for his cavalry, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. <br>
            20 &para; All the people who were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel&mdash; <br>
            21 that is, their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel had not been able to destroy completely&mdash;from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day. <br>
            22 But of the children of Israel Solomon made no forced laborers, because they were men of war and his servants: his officers, his captains, commanders of his chariots, and his cavalry. <br>
            23 &para; Others were chiefs of the officials who were over Solomon&rsquo;s work: five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people who did the work. <br>
            24 &para; But Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter came up from the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her. Then he built the Millo. <br>
            25 &para; Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for the LORD, and he burned incense with them on the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the temple. <br>
            26 &para; King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. <br>
            27 Then Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, to work with the servants of Solomon. <br>
            28 And they went to Ophir, and acquired four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon. </font></td>

              2 that the cities which Hiram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them; and he settled the children of Israel there. <br>
              3 And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it. <br>
              4 He also built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities which he built in Hamath. <br>
              5 He built Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars, <br>
              6 also Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities and the cities of the cavalry, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. <br>

            10 And others were chiefs of the officials of King Solomon: two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people. <br>
            11 &para; Now Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the house he had built for her, for he said, &ldquo;My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy.&rdquo; <br>
            12 &para; Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD which he had built before the vestibule, <br>
            13 according to the daily rate, offering according to the commandment of Moses, for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three appointed yearly feasts&mdash;the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. <br>
            14 And, according to the order of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, the Levites for their duties (to praise and serve before the priests) as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate; for so David the man of God had commanded. <br>
            15 They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries. <br>
            16 &para; Now all the work of Solomon was well-ordered from the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed. <br>
            17 &para; Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the seacoast, in the land of Edom. <br>
            18 And Hiram sent him ships by the hand of his servants, and servants who knew the sea. They went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and acquired four hundred and fifty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon. </font></td>

		<p><b>Solomon is cruising along on all eight cylinders at this point in his reign - the royal donkey express.</b> He's spent 20 years of his 40-year reign building the temple and a really, really nice house for himself. He used forced labor (non Israelites) to do all the work. I mean...he had it all - armies, ships and dominance. <b>All the surrounding kings wanted to be Solomon's best buddy. </b></p>
		<p>King Hiram of Tyre (who provided Solomon's Lebanon timber) didn't much like his vendor deal (20 cities selected by Solomon in Galilee), but...no problem, Solomon...whatever you say! Hiram did give them a nickname, though, calling them the &quot;land of Cabul,&quot; a derogatory term indicating how little they were worth.</p>
		<p>The King of Egypt (whose daughter was married to Solomon) gave him the whole city of Gezer (about 20 miles from Jerusalem) as a dowry for his daughter. It's interesting that, while Gezer was located in Israel, it had not been previously purged of Canaanites. The Tribe of Ephraim failed to do so in <a href="8-6.html#House" target="_blank">I Kings 7:1-12 (see notes)</a> that he apparently had built her another house in Jerusalem near his own.</font></p>
	<p>Times are good for Israel; we're now 20 years into Solomon's reign and Solomon is truly the big player in the region. Those Canaanites who stayed around now serve as slaves. <font size="3">We see from  II Chronicles 8:13-15 that <b>Solomon was very conscientious and intense about his commitment to God</b> at this point in time. He observed the three annual Jewish festivals: the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tabernacles. <a title="Jewish Feasts" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Feasts.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the Feasts.</a> He had the temple priests working their shifts, and God was prospering Israel under his reign. <b>Times are truly good for Solomon and Israel.</b></font></p>
		<p>Solomon even established a navy with some of the manpower supplied by King Hiram of Tyre. Solomon's ships subsequently went to a region (Ophir) and brought back gold for Solomon's coffers.</p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Again, it should be noted that Solomon experienced a significant slippage in his commitment to God during the last half of his reign.</b> <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="8-18.html#Solomon" target="_blank">I Kings 11 (see notes)</a> outlines his shortcomings.</font></p>
