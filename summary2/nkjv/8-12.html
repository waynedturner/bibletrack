				</b></font>Notice Proverbs 25:1, &quot;These are also proverbs of Solomon, <b>which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</b>&quot; We find in these next five chapters of Proverbs sayings with a little different format than we saw in the earlier chapters. These sayings, according to the introduction, were collected by King Hezekiah's men (715-686); Hezekiah is found in <a title="II Kings 18 and II Chronicles 29 Summary" href="9-24.html#Top" target="_blank">II Kings 18-20 and II Chronicles 29-32 (see notes)</a>. So, according to verse 1 here, these proverbs in 25-29 were, indeed, written by Solomon, but not collected into book form until done so by Hezekiah's authority over 300 years later. Here, Solomon talks about reputation, integrity, wisdom and the fool.<font size="4"><b><br>

		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied: <br>
		    2 	It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,<br>
But the glory of kings is to search out a matter. <br>
3 	As the heavens for height and the earth for depth,<br>
So the heart of kings is unsearchable. <br>
4 	Take away the dross from silver,<br>
And it will go to the silversmith for jewelry. <br>
5 	Take away the wicked from before the king,<br>
And his throne will be established in righteousness. <br>
6 	Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king,<br>
And do not stand in the place of the great; <br>
7 	For it is better that he say to you,<br>
&ldquo;Come up here,&rdquo;<br>
Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,<br>
Whom your eyes have seen. <br>
8 	Do not go hastily to court;<br>
For what will you do in the end,<br>
When your neighbor has put you to shame? <br>
9 	Debate your case with your neighbor,<br>
And do not disclose the secret to another; <br>
10 	Lest he who hears it expose your shame,<br>
And your reputation be ruined. <br>
11 	A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold<br>
In settings of silver. <br>
12 	Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold<br>
Is a wise rebuker to an obedient ear. <br>
13 	Like the cold of snow in time of harvest<br>
Is a faithful messenger to those who send him,<br>
For he refreshes the soul of his masters. <br>
14 	Whoever falsely boasts of giving<br>
Is like clouds and wind without rain. <br>
15 	By long forbearance a ruler is persuaded,<br>
And a gentle tongue breaks a bone. <br>
16 	Have you found honey?<br>
Eat only as much as you need,<br>
Lest you be filled with it and vomit. <br>
17 	Seldom set foot in your neighbor&rsquo;s house,<br>
Lest he become weary of you and hate you. <br>
18 	A man who bears false witness against his neighbor<br>
Is like a club, a sword, and a sharp arrow. <br>
19 	Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble<br>
Is like a bad tooth and a foot out of joint. <br>
20 	Like one who takes away a garment in cold weather,<br>
And like vinegar on soda,<br>
Is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. <br>
21 	If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat;<br>
And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink; <br>
22 	For so you will heap coals of fire on his head,<br>
And the LORD will reward you. <br>
23 	The north wind brings forth rain,<br>
And a backbiting tongue an angry countenance. <br>
24 	It is better to dwell in a corner of a housetop,<br>
Than in a house shared with a contentious woman. <br>
25 	As cold water to a weary soul,<br>
So is good news from a far country. <br>
26 	A righteous man who falters before the wicked<br>
Is like a murky spring and a polluted well. <br>
27 	It is not good to eat much honey;<br>
So to seek one&rsquo;s own glory is not glory. <br>
28 	Whoever has no rule over his own spirit<br>
Is like a city broken down, without walls. </font></p>

		<p>In <a title="Luke 14:7-14 Summary" href="4-11.html#Big" target="_blank">Luke 14:7-14 (see notes)</a> Jesus reiterated the principle found right here in verses 6-7, &quot;Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king, And do not stand in the place of the great;  For it is better that he say to you, &ldquo;Come up here,&rdquo; Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, Whom your eyes have seen. &quot;<br>

<p><b><font size="4">Let's talk about some fools Solomon had known (Proverbs 26)</font></b><b><font size="4"><br>
	    </font></b></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 As snow in summer and rain in harvest,<br>
So honor is not fitting for a fool. <br>
2 Like a flitting sparrow, like a flying swallow, <br>
So a curse without cause shall not alight. <br>
3 A whip for the horse, <br>
A bridle for the donkey, <br>
And a rod for the fool&rsquo;s back. <br>
4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, <br>
Lest you also be like him. <br>
5 Answer a fool according to his folly, <br>
Lest he be wise in his own eyes. <br>
6 He who sends a message by the hand of a fool <br>
Cuts off his own feet and drinks violence. <br>
7 Like the legs of the lame that hang limp <br>
Is a proverb in the mouth of fools. <br>
8 Like one who binds a stone in a sling <br>
Is he who gives honor to a fool. <br>
9 Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard <br>
Is a proverb in the mouth of fools. <br>
10 The great God who formed everything <br>
Gives the fool his hire and the transgressor his wages.<br>
11 As a dog returns to his own vomit, <br>
So a fool repeats his folly. <br>
12 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? <br>
There is more hope for a fool than for him. <br>
13 The lazy man says, &ldquo;There is a lion in the road! <br>
A fierce lion is in the streets!&rdquo; <br>
14 As a door turns on its hinges, <br>
So does the lazy man on his bed. <br>
15 The lazy man buries his hand in the bowl;<br>
It wearies him to bring it back to his mouth. <br>
16 The lazy man is wiser in his own eyes <br>
Than seven men who can answer sensibly. <br>
17 He who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own <br>
Is like one who takes a dog by the ears. <br>
18 Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death, <br>
19 Is the man who deceives his neighbor, <br>
And says, &ldquo;I was only joking!&rdquo; <br>
20 Where there is no wood, the fire goes out; <br>
And where there is no talebearer, strife ceases. <br>
21 As charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire, <br>
So is a contentious man to kindle strife. <br>
22 The words of a talebearer are like tasty trifles, <br>
And they go down into the inmost body. <br>
23 Fervent lips with a wicked heart <br>
Are like earthenware covered with silver dross. <br>
24 He who hates, disguises it with his lips, <br>
And lays up deceit within himself; <br>
25 When he speaks kindly, do not believe him, <br>
For there are seven abominations in his heart; <br>
26 Though his hatred is covered by deceit, <br>
His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly. <br>
27 Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, <br>
And he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him. <br>
28 A lying tongue hates those who are crushed by it, <br>
And a flattering mouth works ruin.</font></p>
