		</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">1 Now Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his forces together; thirty-two kings were with him, with horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria, and made war against it. <br>
      2 Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, and said to him, &ldquo;Thus says Ben-hadad: <br>
      3 &ldquo;Your silver and your gold are mine; your loveliest wives and children are mine.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
      4 &para; And the king of Israel answered and said, &ldquo;My lord, O king, just as you say, I and all that I have are yours.&rdquo; <br>
      5 &para; Then the messengers came back and said, &ldquo;Thus speaks Ben-hadad, saying, &ldquo;Indeed I have sent to you, saying, &lsquo;You shall deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children&rdquo;; <br>
      6 but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants. And it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they will put it in their hands and take it.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
      7 &para; So the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, &ldquo;Notice, please, and see how this man seeks trouble, for he sent to me for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold; and I did not deny him.&rdquo; <br>
      8 &para; And all the elders and all the people said to him, &ldquo;Do not listen or consent.&rdquo; <br>
      9 &para; Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, &ldquo;Tell my lord the king, &lsquo;All that you sent for to your servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; &para; And the messengers departed and brought back word to him. <br>
      10 &para; Then Ben-hadad sent to him and said, &ldquo;The gods do so to me, and more also, if enough dust is left of Samaria for a handful for each of the people who follow me.&rdquo; <br>
      11 &para; So the king of Israel answered and said, &ldquo;Tell him, &lsquo;Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
      12 &para; And it happened when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he and the kings were drinking at the command post, that he said to his servants, &ldquo;Get ready.&rdquo; And they got ready to attack the city.  <br>
    </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Benhadad, along with 32 vassal kings, besiege Ahab's capital, Samaria. He then sends messengers to extort Ahab's valuables (wives, children, silver, gold, etc.). At first Ahab expresses his intent to be compliant with Benhadad's demand when he says in verse 4, &quot;I and all that I have are yours.&quot; Benhadad's messengers come a second time - this time demanding that Ahab allow them to search the premises and take with them &quot;whatever is pleasant in your eyes.&quot; When Ahab recognizes the extent to which Benhadad plans to bankrupt him, he sends a rather meek message back to Benhadad respectfully declining to comply with this most recent demand - this, of course, after a meeting with his cabinet. Big ol' bully Benhadad sends a royal message of intimidation when he says in verse 10, &quot;The gods do so to me, and more also, if enough dust is left of Samaria for a handful for each of the people who follow me.&quot; In other words, &quot;When we're finished with you, there won't be enough left of Samaria to provide a handful of dust for my soldiers as they leave!&quot; Ahab replies through the messengers back to Benhadad, &quot;Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.&quot; That's the equivalent of, &quot;Talk is cheap, show me what you got!&quot; OK! <b>The stage is set for war between Syria and Israel.</b></p>
  <p>Incidentally, &quot;Benhadad&quot; was the name of a dynasty of kings of Syria. The Hebrew word &quot;ben&quot; means &quot;son.&quot; Therefore, &quot;Benhadad&quot; means &quot;son of Hadad.&quot; King Asa of Judah had enlisted the help of his father (also Benhadad) back in <a title="I Kings 15; II Chronicles 16 Summary" href="8-23.html#Years" target="_blank">I Kings 15:16-24; II Chronicles 16:1-14 (see notes)</a> to assist him in defeating King Baasha of Israel.</p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>Sometimes only a war will do - round #1 (I Kings 20:13-21)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">13 &para; Suddenly a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel, saying, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the LORD.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
		    14 &para; So Ahab said, &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; &para; And he said, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;By the young leaders of the provinces.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; &para; Then he said, &ldquo;Who will set the battle in order?&rdquo; &para; And he answered, &ldquo;You.&rdquo; <br>
		    15 &para; Then he mustered the young leaders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he mustered all the people, all the children of Israel&mdash;seven thousand. <br>
		    16 &para; So they went out at noon. Meanwhile Ben-hadad and the thirty-two kings helping him were getting drunk at the command post. <br>
		    17 The young leaders of the provinces went out first. And Ben-hadad sent out a patrol, and they told him, saying, &ldquo;Men are coming out of Samaria!&rdquo; <br>
		    18 So he said, &ldquo;If they have come out for peace, take them alive; and if they have come out for war, take them alive.&rdquo; <br>
		    19 &para; Then these young leaders of the provinces went out of the city with the army which followed them. <br>
		    20 And each one killed his man; so the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the cavalry. <br>
		    21 Then the king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.  <br>

    </blockquote>
	<p>This story is a bit of a puzzler. Ahab was a very wicked king...record-setting wickedness. Yet, he receives some assistance from a prophet of God in this passage. Israel makes a preemptive strike on Syria. <b>As rotten as Ahab was, God spoke to him through an unnamed prophet</b> and told him that he would prevail. Why? To prove the power of the one true God. When Ahab's meager army (7,000 men) shows up outside the city where Benhadad and his men are camped, drunken Benhadad thinks that perhaps this small contingent from Ahab has come in peace. Yet, as Benhadad's men approach, they are all slaughtered as they flee; Benhadad manages to escape.</p>
		<p>You may wonder how it was that Ahab was only able to muster an army of 7,000 men. It was only 50 or so years before that King Jeroboam had lost 500,000 men in his battle against Judah's King Abijam (aka Abijah) back in <a href="8-23.html#Rehoboam" title="I Kings 15 Summary" target="_blank">II Chronicles 13:17 (see notes)</a>. That would have left a lot of widows in Israel back then. It takes a few generations to recover from that big of a loss of life.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Syria clashes with Israel - round #2 (I Kings 20:22-30)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">22 &para; And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him, &ldquo;Go, strengthen yourself; take note, and see what you should do, for in the spring of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.&rdquo; <br>
    23 &para; Then the servants of the king of Syria said to him, &ldquo;Their gods are gods of the hills. Therefore they were stronger than we; but if we fight against them in the plain, surely we will be stronger than they. <br>
    24 So do this thing: Dismiss the kings, each from his position, and put captains in their places; <br>
    25 and you shall muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain; surely we will be stronger than they.&rdquo; &para; And he listened to their voice and did so. <br>
    26 &para; So it was, in the spring of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. <br>
    27 And the children of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and they went against them. Now the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the countryside. <br>
    28 &para; Then a man of God came and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &ldquo;Because the Syrians have said, &lsquo;The LORD is God of the hills, but He is not God of the valleys,&rdquo; therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
    29 And they encamped opposite each other for seven days. So it was that on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians in one day. <br>
    30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; then a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men who were left. &para; And Ben-hadad fled and went into the city, into an inner chamber.  <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benhadad prepares for war again the following year, but Ahab's unnamed prophet told him to expect it. However, with his meager army, Ahab prevails against the 127,000+ troops of King Benhadad of Syria a second time. Look at the statement in verse 27 regarding how lopsided the fighting forces were, &quot;the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the countryside.&quot; </p>
<p>How had Israel prevailed against Benhadad's massive army? Verses 23-25 seem to indicate that Benhadad's war cabinet was not made up of the brightest people. They had determined that Israel's &quot;gods&quot; were hill specialists; Syria's gods were plains specialists. This second round of warfare must be fought in the open field. One more thing -  those kings that led the troops the first time didn't know what they were doing; the second time they put captains in their places. Boom - same result - total defeat! After a loss of 100,000 men, Benhadad flees to the nearby northern Israeli city (Aphek), but the city's walls fall in (killing another 27,000), and Benhadad is surrounded.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>What!!!!! Release the evil King Benhadad? (I Kings 20:31-34)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">31 &para; Then his servants said to him, &ldquo;Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please, let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will spare your life.&rdquo; <br>
    32 So they wore sackcloth around their waists and put ropes around their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, &ldquo;Your servant Ben-hadad says, &lsquo;Please let me live.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; &para; And he said, &ldquo;Is he still alive? He is my brother.&rdquo; <br>
    33 &para; Now the men were watching closely to see whether any sign of mercy would come from him; and they quickly grasped at this word and said, &ldquo;Your brother Ben-hadad.&rdquo; &para; So he said, &ldquo;Go, bring him.&rdquo; Then Ben-hadad came out to him; and he had him come up into the chariot. <br>
    34 &para; So Ben-hadad said to him, &ldquo;The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you may set up marketplaces for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.&rdquo; &para; Then Ahab said, &ldquo;I will send you away with this treaty.&rdquo; So he made a treaty with him and sent him away.  <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you believe the big bully King Benhadad, who flexed his muscles before the war, is now pleading for his life? What a yellow-bellied coward! And then...what about Ahab! Benhadad had threatened to plunder everything Ahab treasured...and <b>Ahab lets him go, and even makes a covenant with him?</b> Incredible! However, Benhadad is not home free quite yet.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>How does a prophet get an audience with the King? (I Kings 20:35-43)</b></font><br>
		</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">35 &para; Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the LORD, &ldquo;Strike me, please.&rdquo; And the man refused to strike him. <br>
    36 Then he said to him, &ldquo;Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, surely, as soon as you depart from me, a lion shall kill you.&rdquo; And as soon as he left him, a lion found him and killed him. <br>
    37 &para; And he found another man, and said, &ldquo;Strike me, please.&rdquo; So the man struck him, inflicting a wound. <br>
    38 Then the prophet departed and waited for the king by the road, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes. <br>
    39 Now as the king passed by, he cried out to the king and said, &ldquo;Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and there, a man came over and brought a man to me, and said, &lsquo;Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.&rsquo; <br>
    40 While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.&rdquo; &para; Then the king of Israel said to him, &ldquo;So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.&rdquo; <br>
    41 &para; And he hastened to take the bandage away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. <br>
    42 Then he said to him, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;Because you have let slip out of your hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
  43 &para; So the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased, and came to Samaria. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prophet (apparently a different one than before) asks a neighbor to injure him so that he can fake a battle injury. After the neighbor refuses, he's eaten by a lion as the prophet had prophesied for his refusal. A second man complies with the prophet's request, injures the prophet and thus the prophet fakes a battle injury to get the king's attention as he passes by. Upon Ahab's arrival to the scene, the prophet spins a scenario (a lie, really) of having lost a Syrian prisoner charged to his custody. When Ahab decrees that he should be punished for this negligence, the prophet blasts him with the word from God. Here's the bad news, Ahab. You should not have let Benhadad snooker you into letting him leave in peace - it's gonna cost you your life. Sometimes you just can't win for losing...true when you disobey God. Actually, Ahab had no right to spare the life of a king whom he had not defeated. Only God had that authority.</p>
<p><a name="Jezebel"></a><font size="4"><b>Jezebel - one shrewd businesswoman (I Kings 21:1-16)</b></font><br>
			</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 And it came to pass after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. <br>
    2 So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, &ldquo;Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near, next to my house; and for it I will give you a vineyard better than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.&rdquo; <br>
    3 &para; But Naboth said to Ahab, &ldquo;The LORD forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!&rdquo; <br>
    4 &para; So Ahab went into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, &ldquo;I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.&rdquo; And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food. <br>
    5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, &ldquo;Why is your spirit so sullen that you eat no food?&rdquo; <br>
    6 &para; He said to her, &ldquo;Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, &ldquo;Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.&rsquo; And he answered, &lsquo;I will not give you my vineyard.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
    7 &para; Then Jezebel his wife said to him, &ldquo;You now exercise authority over Israel! Arise, eat food, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.&rdquo; <br>
    8 &para; And she wrote letters in Ahab&rsquo;s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naboth. <br>
    9 She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth with high honor among the people; <br>
    10 and seat two men, scoundrels, before him to bear witness against him, saying, You have blasphemed God and the king. Then take him out, and stone him, that he may die. <br>
    11 &para; So the men of his city, the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them. <br>
    12 They proclaimed a fast, and seated Naboth with high honor among the people. <br>
    13 And two men, scoundrels, came in and sat before him; and the scoundrels witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, &ldquo;Naboth has blasphemed God and the king!&rdquo; Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died. <br>
    14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, &ldquo;Naboth has been stoned and is dead.&rdquo; <br>
    15 &para; And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, &ldquo;Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.&rdquo; <br>
    16 So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.  <br>
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You've heard of the woman behind the man? That's Jezebel - Ahab was nothing without her. She was the woman behind the man, and Ahab was a whiner. Naboth, a resident of Israel, won't release his garden to Ahab, so he sulks in earshot of Jezebel. No problem for a mover and shaker like Jezebel - she has Naboth framed by a couple of &quot;scoundrels&quot; (KJV - &quot;sons of Belial&quot; - <a href="#Belial">see definition below</a>) and subsequently stoned to death by his own townspeople for a crime he did not commit (blaspheming God and the king)...just so Ahab can have his garden. <b>Jezebel was a ruthless woman. </b>Do you still wonder why Mamas don't name their little girls Jezebel?</p>
<p><a name="Belial"></a><b>Note regarding KJV translation &quot;sons of Belial&quot; in verse 10:</b> While the KJV frequently transliterates the Hebrew word, &quot;Belial,&quot; as a proper name, in fact it is a general Hebrew word meaning worthless or wicked. Seeing it capitalized, one might get the impression that it was the name of a pagan god, but not so. The NKJV translates it as scoundrels.</p>

		    19 You shall speak to him, saying, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;Have you murdered and also taken possession?&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; And you shall speak to him, saying, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick your blood, even yours.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
		    20 &para; So Ahab said to Elijah, &ldquo;Have you found me, O my enemy?&rdquo; &para; And he answered, &ldquo;I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD: <br>

		    24 The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Ahab and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field.&rdquo; <br>
		    25 &para; But there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the LORD, because Jezebel his wife stirred him up. <br>

		    27 &para; So it was, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his body, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went about mourning. <br>

    </blockquote>
	<p>For a prophet of God, when times are good, they're real good; when they're bad, well...you know. And <b>times are bad in Israel.</b> Elijah gets his assignment from God, &quot;Go confront King Ahab because of the death of Naboth.&quot; Look at how this charming couple is described in I Kings 21:25, &quot;But there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the LORD, because Jezebel his wife stirred him up.&quot; It looks as though Ahab still holds the record for wickedness. King Ahab sees Elijah and refers to him as &quot;my enemy.&quot; Ahab is evil - very evil, but nothing compared to his charming wife, Jezebel. Elijah's prophecy against this dynamic evil duo features dogs...that's right, dogs. First of all, dogs will lick up the blood from King Ahab's dead body at the very site where Naboth had been stoned. And...dogs will actually eat Jezebel. By the way, that happens to Jezebel in <a title="II Kings 9 Summary" href="9-4.html#Kings" target="_blank">II Kings 9:14-29 (see notes)</a>.</p>
	<p>Charles Ryrie (Ryrie's Study Bible) makes an interesting point here: &quot;Ahab&#146;s repentance was not accompanied by acts (such as restoring Naboth&#146;s vineyard to his family or tearing down the altars to Baal) that would prove it was genuine.&quot;</p>
	<p>Incidentally, Elijah's promise to Ahab that all of his male descendants&nbsp; will be terminated is expressed in a very interesting
		    way in the Hebrew text. Of modern translations, only the King James Version keeps the Hebrew
    phrase intact in verse 21 when it says &quot;him that pisseth against the wall.&quot; That's exactly how the Hebrew phrase identifies these male heirs.</p>
