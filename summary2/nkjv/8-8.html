		<p>Of all the people among whom God could have chosen to dwell, we're it. Of all the places in which God could have had a temple built, this is it. Solomon blesses the people of Jerusalem this day. As he speaks to the people of Israel, he reviews the provisions of the Davidic Covenant proclaiming that Israel is the nation of God and that the throne of David shall endure forever (<a href="6-19.html#Temple" title="II Samuel 7 Summary" target="_blank">II Samuel 7:12-16, see notes</a>). In his presentation, he points out that God had authorized the building of this new temple by David's son, Solomon himself.</p>

<p>This is the same looooong prayer that we also see in <a title="I Kings 8 Summary" href="8-7.html#Dedication" target="_blank">I Kings 8:22-53 (see notes)</a>. <font color="#0000FF">That text is shown in blue above.</font> The people are listening in as Solomon kneels on a scaffold built there in the temple courtyard especially for this occasion. Solomon outlines the supernatural aspects of the new temple. Notice Solomon's acknowledgment of the fact that we are all sinners in verse 36. As a matter of fact, Solomon's prayer here is one that points out that man's solutions to his problems are to be found in prayer before God.</p>

63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. <br>
64 On the same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the LORD; for there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings. <br>
65 &para; At that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven more days&mdash;fourteen days. <br>
66 On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the good that the LORD had done for His servant David, and for Israel His people. </font></td>

<p>Remember the big pool for the priests to wash in before they sacrifice? Second question: Do you remember from <a title="I Chronicles 24 Summary" href="7-13.html#Shift" target="_blank">I Chronicles 24 (see notes)</a> the 24,000 Levites who were assigned to 24 shifts to work in the temple? Well, the really big pool gets a really big visitation this first week - we're getting ready to sacrifice 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep...and those who were priests must be ceremonially clean when they do it. Oh - and remember the really, really big altar (about 36.5 feet square) that was built for sacrificing animals? It's getting ready to get a steady workout for this dedication. So...imagine with me the dedication scene - let's guess 48 or so priests simultaneously sacrificing at this altar 48 or so animals at a time every 2 to 5 minutes - the sounds, the smell, the hustle - simply an amazing sight and sound. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure I would have had the stomach for priest work. After 7 days, the people went home - whew!</p>

<p>Solomon gets a visit from God himself in verse 12, &quot;Then the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: 'I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice.'&quot; First, God gives Solomon the good news: do right by the One True God, and I will prosper you and your people forever (verses 13-18). The bad news: turn away from the One True God, and disaster will follow (verses 19-22). Here's an oft-quoted verse regarding Israel in verse 14, &quot;if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.&quot; Many preachers and evangelists use this as a verse for America. Since this was a specific promise to Israel based upon God's covenants with Israel, do you think it removes this verse from proper context to use it as a promise to America?</p>
<p><b>II Chronicles 7:17-20 needs some special attention:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>17 As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and My judgments, <br>
18 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, &ldquo;You shall not fail to have a man as ruler in Israel.&rsquo; <br>
19 &para; &ldquo;But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them, <br>
20 then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them; and this house which I have sanctified for My name I will cast out of My sight, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. <br>

	<p>Ironically, Solomon's reign marks the beginning of a slide away from God. We see this clear statement of fact in <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="4-16.html#Warn" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 29-30 (see notes)</a>. The prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea and Amos) had all prophesied that God would restore the kingdom to Israel per the conditions of the Davidic Covenant.</p>

	<p>This is a preferred way for several of the Psalms to begin. See these words in 106:1; 107:1; 118:1. This unknown Psalmist also recounts all the victories and provisions given Israel by God. And then we see the phrase, &quot;For His mercy endures forever.&quot; Solomon may not have written these words, but they're certainly used this day in II Chronicles 5:13, 7:3 and 7:6 as part of the temple dedication.</p>
	<p><b>Following is a brief outline of Psalm 136:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>A call to praise (verses 1-3)
			<li>God&#146;s power as seen in nature (verses 4-9)
			<li>God's work in the history of Israel (verses 10-22)
