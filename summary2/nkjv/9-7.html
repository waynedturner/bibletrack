      6 He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver. <br>

<p>Amaziah had a big army - 300,000 strong. Feeling he needed more, he employs another 100,000 soldiers from his sister country, Israel. When the (unspecified) prophet comes to tell him that God's not happy with the use of these mercenaries, he dismisses them, apparently with full pay. <b>Amaziah's army does well - has a big victory over the Edomites.</b> He seems to violate the modern-day stipulations of the Geneva Convention in verse 12 when he takes 10,000 of those Edomites to the top of a mountain and throws them off. </p>
<p>By the way, remember the army he dismissed comprised of mercenary soldiers from the Northern Kingdom, Israel? Well, that army turns on him and plunders some of the cities of Judah (killing 3,000) while he's out fighting Edom. II Chronicles refers to these Edomites as the &quot;children of Seir,&quot; a reference to the mountain range upon which the Edomites lived. <a href="8-31.html#Edom" title="Obadiah Summary" target="_blank">For a complete look at the Edomites, click here.</a></p>

    15 Therefore the anger of the LORD was aroused against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, &ldquo;Why have you sought the gods of the people, which could not rescue their own people from your hand?&rdquo; <br>
  16 &para; So it was, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, &ldquo;Have we made you the king&rsquo;s counselor? Cease! Why should you be killed?&rdquo; &para; Then the prophet ceased, and said, &ldquo;I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.&rdquo; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is it about kings and their gods? <b>Amaziah started out right, but upon his return from the land of the Edomites, he brings back some of their gods...and makes them his own.</b> God sends a prophet (unspecified) to try to reason with him, but he just won't hear it. I particularly like the line the prophet gives Amaziah, &quot;Why have you adopted the gods of a people who couldn't even protect them in battle against you?&quot; Good point! The prophet issues his prophecy to Amaziah, &quot;I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.&quot; Whoa! You gotta hate to get news like that!</p>
<p>So...Amaziah starts out his reign by serving God, but later begins serving the idols of the conquered Edomites - go figure! Can anything good now come out of a man who makes such a U-turn in his spiritual life. NO!</p>

  <p>After his successful campaign against the Edomites, Amaziah is ready to take on Israel. Apparently he had his eye on the legacy of a united Israel once again - all twelve tribes together as one nation. Joash (aka Jehoash, King of Israel) doesn't want to go to war with Judah - tries to reason with him about war between them, but Amaziah is determined. Perhaps the analogy Joash used in his discussions with Amaziah made him more determined. In the analogy, Joash compares Judah to a thistle and Israel to a full-grown tree. The thistle wants to take the tree as his wife. That analogy, with Judah as the male head of the marriage relationship, shows that Joash understands Amaziah's intentions to be the head over a restored, united kingdom. Only problem - the analogy concludes with a wild beast inadvertently trampling down the insignificant thistle. Reading between the lines, the analogy cries out, &quot;What...are you crazy!&quot; </p>
  <p>Despite the warning, <b>Joash meets Amaziah about 15 miles west of Jerusalem in <font size="3">Bethshemesh</font> and soundly beats him.</b> Then Joash feels he has to come to Jerusalem to teach Amaziah a hard lesson. He takes hostages, valuables and even tears down some of the wall around Jerusalem in the process. The &quot;Gate of Ephraim&quot; (verse 13) indicates that a portion of the wall was destroyed on the northern side of the city, making them vulnerable to attack from the north after that. Amaziah's son, Uzziah, repairs this breach and fortifies the walls later in <a href="9-9.html#Success" title="II Chronicles 26 Summary" target="_blank">II Chronicles 26:9 (see notes)</a>.</p>
  <p>Amaziah is taken prisoner by Joash, King of Israel. He apparently is released from captivity and continues to rule over Judah...outlives Joash by 15 years. Finally, Amaziah is forced to flee Jerusalem to Lachish (about 30 miles southwest), but is captured and executed by his own people. Tough end for a guy who started out with such promise. He is counted worthy by his own people to be buried with his ancestors. Amaziah's sixteen-year-old son, Azariah, is made King of Judah after his father's execution.</p>

    <p><font size="2">23 &para; In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria, and reigned forty-one years. <br>
      24 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin. <br>
      25 He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet who was from Gath Hepher. <br>
      26 For the LORD saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter; and whether bond or free, there was no helper for Israel. <br>
      27 And the LORD did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. <br>
      28 &para; Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did&mdash;his might, how he made war, and how he recaptured for Israel, from Damascus and Hamath, what had belonged to Judah&mdash;are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <br>
    29 So Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the kings of Israel. Then Zechariah his son reigned in his place. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thought you had your fill of Jeroboams? Hold on; there's one more; he's known as Jeroboam II - King of Israel for 41 years. Any chance he'll serve the true God? Nope - no chance. He lives up to his namesake. He had some successes against Syria - actually restored a good bit of real estate back under the control of the Northern Kingdom and leaves a relatively strong kingdom before his death, but he didn't serve God. A significant point of reference is seen in verse 25 where we see mention of &quot;Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet.&quot; From this we know <font size="3">that Jonah prophesied during the reign of Jeroboam II (793-753 B.C.) in Israel. <a title="Jonah Summary" href="9-8.html" target="_blank">Click here to go to the notes on the Book of Jonah.</a></font></p>
  <p><b>The Expositor's Bible Commentary has some interesting insight on verses 27-29:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Because Israel had fallen into such desperate spiritual conditions (vv.26-27), a merciful God had acted on behalf of his people. As he had granted them deliverance from external pressures by sending Adad-Nirari III of Assyria against the Arameans (cf. 13:5, 22-23) initiating a period of recovery under Jehoash (13:25; 14:14-15), so now in a grander way he culminated that deliverance with full victory over the Arameans, one that included Israel&#146;s recovery of its former boundaries (vv.27-28).</p>
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Despite the evil ways of Jeroboam and the Northern Kingdom, Israel, God had mercy upon them and determined that he would not &quot;blot out the name of Israel from under heaven.&quot; Like it or not, sometimes God gives successes to bad people for reasons that have nothing to do with the bad people themselves.</p>
