And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. <br>
2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying, <br>
3 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. <br>
4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying, <br>
5 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD. <br>
6 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David&rsquo;s sake. <br>
7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. <br>
8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day? <br>
9 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? <br>
10 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees. <br>
11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz. </font></td>

9 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness: <br />
10 I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years. <br />
11 I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. <br />
12 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd&rsquo;s tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. <br />
13 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. <br />
14 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me. <br />
15 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul. <br />
16 O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live. <br />
17 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. <br />
18 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. <br />
19 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth. <br />
20 The LORD was ready TO SAVE ME: THEREFORE WE WILL SING MY SONGS TO THE STRINGED INSTRUMENTS ALL THE DAYS OF OUR LIFE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD. <br />
21 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover. <br />

		<p>Hezekiah's sick - real sick - almost dead! We see in verse 7 that Hezekiah had some sort of a boil. The Hebrew word translated &quot;boil&quot; there is used 13 times in the Old Testament (&quot;boil&quot; 11 times and &quot;botch&quot; 2 times in KJV). The skin disease of boils was one of the ten plagues brought by the Lord on Egypt (<a title="Exodus 9 Summary" href="2-12.html#Boils" target="_blank">Exodus 9:9&#150;11, see notes</a>). The Lord threatened boils if Israel chose not to obey him (<a title="Deuteronomy 28 Summary" href="4-16.html#Disobey" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 28:27, 35; see notes</a>). We see these boils associated with leprosy in <a title="Leviticus 13 Summary" href="3-4.html#Leprosy" target="_blank">Leviticus 13 (see notes)</a>, and <a title="Job 2 Summary" href="1-6.html#Satisfied" target="_blank">Job 2:7 (see notes)</a> tells us that Job was covered with boils inflicted upon him by Satan. </p>
	<p>Isaiah tells Hezekiah that he's not gonna make it, but Hezekiah prays - prays hard. Notice how Hezekiah lays out his credentials before God in verse 3 as the basis for feeling a little short changed on life expectancy. He had, in fact, been an exemplary King of Judah (<a href="9-24.html#Cleans" title="II Chronicles 29-30" target="_blank">see notes on II Chronicles 29-30</a>), but he's dying at 39 years of age. As a result, <b>God gives him 15 more years added to his life and promises him safety from Assyria</b> - well worth the effort, I'd say. </p>
	<p>After Isaiah prescribes a lump of figs for the boil, Hezekiah wants a sign that God will keep his promise. How about a miracle with the sun? After a little negotiation with God regarding which way he wanted the sun to abnormally move, backward or forward, Hezekiah decides he'd like to go look at his Dad's (Ahaz) sun dial and see the sun's shadow move back 10 degrees (some specific unit of measurement) on the dial. Since we don't have the details of the construction of this sun dial, we don't know exactly how it was marked. Therefore, it is impossible to tell exactly how much of the day's sunlight was repeated on this occasion. Here's what we do know; God gave a sign of his promise to Hezekiah on the sun dial that was definitive.</p>

        <p>Hezekiah was a trusting guy. When the Babylonians send envoys with we're-glad-you're-well gifts, Hezekiah is just as pleased as can be over how well known he is back in Babylon. He shows them his whole operation - all his gold, silver - everything of value in Jerusalem. When Isaiah discovers that Hezekiah had shown the chicken farm to the foxes (so to speak), he breaks the news to Hezekiah, &quot;You shouldn't have told them all that; they will one day come and take all your riches along with your people and your own descendants.&quot; <b>Hezekiah isn't phased though - says it's a good prophecy; &quot;at least there will be peace in my lifetime,&quot; he concludes.</b> That seems a little short sighted to me. He was a great King of Judah though, and verse 20 points out one of his major municipal-improvement projects - running water to Jerusalem. </p>

2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. <br>
3 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. <br>
4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name. <br>
5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. <br>
6 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. <br>
7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: <br>
8 Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them. <br>
9 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel. <br>
10 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, <br>
11 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: <br>
12 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. <br>
13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down. <br>
14 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; <br>
15 Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day. <br>
16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. <br>
17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <br>
18 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. </font></td>
        <td align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#cce1ff" width="50%"><font color="#0000FF" size="2">1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem: <br>
        2 But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. <br>
        3 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. <br>
        4 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever. <br>
        5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. <br>
        6 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. <br>
        7 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: <br>
        8 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. <br>
        9 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel. <br>
        10 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken. <br>
        11 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. <br>
        12 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, <br>
        13 And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God. <br>
        14 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah. <br>
        15 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city. <br>
        16 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. <br>
        17 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only. <br>
        18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel. <br>
        19 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers. <br>
        20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. </font></td>

    <p><b>How could such a righteous king like Hezekiah have such a rotten son?</b> He was really, really rotten - rebuilt all the pagan altars once again including altars to Baal and the Phoenician gods too. He even erected these pagan altars right there in the temple. Wait, there's more; <b>he burned to death his own son on the pagan altars he erected.</b> Manasseh was into fortune tellers, wizards and mediums. He started reigning when he was 12 and reigned for 55 years - all bad all the time. How bad was he? Verse 9 says, &quot;Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.&quot; That's pretty bad! Then come the prophets to prophesy against him. God is going to turn Jerusalem upside down and deliver them into the hands of their enemies - all because Manasseh led Jerusalem into such wickedness. He dies...finally!</p>
    <p><b>Ezra, in writing to the exiles, adds an addendum to the life of Manasseh.</b> He got second a chance in life, but failed to make the most out of it. <a title="II Chronicles 33 Summary" href="10-14.html#Manasseh" target="_blank">Click here to the summary on Manasseh from II Chronicles 33:10-20.</a> It is most interesting that Manasseh's repentance is not reported by the author of II Kings. Perhaps it is because the evil Manasseh had done prior to his capture by the Assyrians made it impossible for significant changes to take effect in Judah after his release.</p>

              14 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.  <br>
              15 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.  <br>
              16 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. </p>

              3 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.  <br>
              4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.  <br>
              5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.  <br>
              6 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.  <br>
              7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:  <br>
              8 Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.  <br>
              9 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel. </p>
              <p>II Chronicles 33<br>
              2 But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.  <br>
              3 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.  <br>
              4 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.  <br>
              5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.  <br>
              6 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.  <br>
              7 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:  <br>
              8 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.  <br>
              9 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel. </p></td>

		<p>He was Manasseh's son and only reigned two years - rotten too! His servants killed him. Then the people killed the servants and put his 8-year-old son, Josiah, on the throne as King of Judah. Have you noticed that while Israel's kings came from a half dozen or more different family lines before the Northern Kingdom fell, Judah's kings all came from the same family - from the line of David? That's one principle of prophecy the people of Judah adhered to faithfully...maintaining the line of David.</p>
