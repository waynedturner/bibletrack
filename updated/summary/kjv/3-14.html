      2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. <br>
      3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? <br>
      4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. <br>
      5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <br>
      6 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. <br>
      7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, <br>
      8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. <br>
      9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. <br>
      10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: <br>
      11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. <br>
      12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? <br>
      13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.<br>
      14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. <br>
      15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. <br>
      16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? <br>
      17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? <br>
      18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. <br>
      19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: <br>
      20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. <br>

    <td align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#cce1ff"><p><font size="2">1 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. <br>
      2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. <br>
      3 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. <br>
      4 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. <br>
      5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? <br>
      6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. <br>
      7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. <br>
      8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. <br>
      9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. <br>
      10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death: <br>
      11 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free. <br>
      12 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother; <br>
      13 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye. <br>
      14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: <br>
      15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. <br>
      16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. <br>
      17 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. <br>
      18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; <br>
      19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? <br>
      20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. <br>
      21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, <br>
      22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: <br>
      23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man. <br>

<p><b>The Pharisees washed their hands...a lot!</b> They acknowledge in this passage that the practice was &quot;the tradition of the elders.&quot; Literally, <b>it was part of the oral tradition that had been passed down.</b> This oral tradition is the equivalent of our federal judges issuing opinions regarding applications of our United States Constitution. These oral traditions were finally written down in the second century A.D. into what is known as the <b>Mishnah, a six-volume set of books.</b> By the fifth century the oral addendum to the Mishnah had grown into a <b>63-volume set of books known as the Talmud.</b> Try reading that through in a year!</p>
<p><b>This hand-washing ritual before meals, the violation of which the disciples were being criticized, had no basis in the Law of Moses.</b> However, since it was one of those very sacred extra-scriptural observances of these pious Jewish leaders, they were very critical. It was not a question of hygiene, but moral purity as far as they were concerned - <b>all man-made law. </b>Mark goes into more detail than Matthew regarding the background and basis of this Pharisaical practice of ritual washings in verses 2-5 of his account.</p>
	<p><b>How do you answer a stupid question?</b> I say &quot;stupid question&quot; because this hand-washing doctrine had no basis in Mosaic Law. it wasn't a sincere query...just the Pharisees trying to find fault with Jesus and his disciples. Jesus chooses another of their &quot;laws&quot; to show how they blatantly had been using their special supplement to the Law of Moses for selfish gain. On the one hand, they considered it their personal responsibility to <b>care for their parents in their old age.</b> As a matter of fact, Jesus mentions two laws regarding the treatment of parents - the fifth commandment found in <a href="2-17.html#Commandments" title="Exodus 20 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 20:12 (see notes)</a> and the provision which forbids cursing one's parents in <a href="2-17.html#Violence" title="Exodus 21 Summary" target="_blank">Exodus 21:17 (see notes)</a>. </p>
	<p>But what if you were so selfish that you didn't want to take care of your parents. Here's the <b>loophole - called &quot;corban.&quot;</b> That's the Hebrew word for &quot;offering&quot; to God, used 82 times in the Old Testament in the context of sacrificial offerings/oblations brought to the Tabernacle/Temple; 78 of those times are found in Leviticus and Numbers. <b>Mark uses the exact Hebrew word (transliterated) in his account; he wants to make certain his readers understand exactly what loophole these hypocritical Pharisees are invoking.</b> However, they offered their possessions with a little bit of a twist. They would pledge their possessions to God (the temple) at their deaths with full rights to use their own wealth as long as they desired while they were living. However, (as they practiced it) <b>this pledge prevented them from giving away any of these possessions for any reason, including provisions for their parents in their old age</b> (or so they said). &quot;Sorry Mom and Dad - can't help - pledged all my possessions to God.&quot; Incidentally, what must your parents have done to you as a child to merit such treatment? What a loophole! Do you think that kind of hypocrisy and legal acrobatics will go unnoticed by Jesus? He immediately points out that Isaiah had prophesied this kind of conduct by a disobedient Jewish nation in <a title="Isaiah 29 Summary" href="9-28.html#Siege" target="_blank">Isaiah 29:13 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men.&quot; Jesus quotes Isaiah in Matthew 15:9 when he says, &quot;But in vain they do worship me,<b> teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</b>&quot; Wow! That's exactly what they were doing. And...I'm afraid that many religious people are still doing that today...just like Isaiah said they would...just like the Pharisees. <b>So, what happens when you mix tradition into your doctrine, giving it the same weight as scripture?</b> There's your answer in Mark 7:13, &quot;<b>Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition,</b> which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.&quot;</p>
	<p><b>&quot;Hey Jesus! We think you insulted the Pharisees with this one,&quot;</b> the disciples reported in Matthew 15:12. Matthew, as an Apostle, would have been on the scene when this exchange took place. He recalls in his account the concern the disciples had with regard to how this conflict seemed to set with the hypocritical Jewish leaders. Does it appear that Jesus' disciples may have thought it better to compromise a little on this one? Obviously, they just didn't quite get it either. <b>Hygiene is good, but moral purity has nothing to do with ritually washing ones hands before eating</b> or the sanitary condition of substances taken into the body. Here's what defiles: that which proceeds from a man. <b>Here's the list of defiling conduct in Matthew 15:19 and Mark 7:21-22. </b></p>
		<p>Jesus uses &quot;heart&quot; (Greek: kardia) in this context the same way we use it in English today, figuratively as the seat of the emotions and as the seat of thought. No educated person in Jesus' day believed that thinking processes literally took place in the heart. Therefore, when Jesus refers to a defiled heart, he is speaking of one who stands in rebellion against God. This defilement is a product of the Adamic nature of man. In other words, <b>these Jewish leaders about whom Jesus was speaking did not have an authentic relationship with God.</b> That's the core problem Jesus is addressing here.</p>
		<p>On an amusing side note, the word used for what builders today call the water closet is referred to as the &quot;draught&quot; (Matthew 15:17, Mark 7:19) in the KJV. The Greek word is &quot;aphedron,&quot; a compound noun including the preposition for &quot;away from&quot; and &quot;sitting.&quot; So, the &quot;draught&quot; of the KJV is a place where one sits away from everyone else. </p>

		<p><b>Jesus is north of Israel up near Tyre and Sidon (in Syria) ministering. </b>This woman is of Canaanite descent according to Matthew, and Mark reports that she is a native of the Phoenician seaboard up in Syria (&quot;Syrophenician&quot;) - probably Greek in religion, and also in speech. She is quite perceptive when she cries out to Jesus, &quot;Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David.&quot; Matthew saw the exact phrasing of this plea to be significant. It demonstrated that she knew who Jesus was and why he had come...his Messianic mission. Jesus points out that his primary ministry is to present himself as Messiah to the Jews, and she's a gentile, not a Jew. She's persistent though - not really interested in technicalities. Could it be that she also understood that the prophet Isaiah had prophesied that the Messiah would also be ministering to Gentiles (<a title="Isaiah 54 Summary" href="10-9.html#Future" target="_blank">Isaiah 54, see notes</a>)? She's a quick thinker too - very fluent with the perfect rebuttal - the dogs-eating-crumbs rebuttal. As scavengers, dogs ate whatever wasn't consumed by the intended recipient. <b>Result: Jesus heals her daughter.</b></p>

<p>Jesus left Syria and is now ministering in Decapolis, southeast of the Sea of Galilee; this area was predominantly occupied by Greeks where Matthew simply reports that Jesus healed a &quot;multitude&quot; of people who were brought to him. Mark, on the other hand, recalls for us on that occasion the healing of one particular man, a deaf/dumb man. Mark gives a detailed account, including the Aramaic word (&quot;Ephphatha&quot;) Jesus uses when he commands that the man's ears &quot;be opened.&quot; The multitude is impressed and subsequently publish these miracles despite Jesus' plea that they not do so.</p>

<p>This crowd has been with Jesus for three days, and they're hungry - all 4,000 of them. Matthew points out that the 4,000 was just an accounting of the men present who were fed, not counting &quot;women and children.&quot; Look at the questions posed by the disciples in verse 33, &quot;Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?&quot; Hey! Didn't you guys learn anything back in <a title="Matthew 14 Summary" href="3-6.html#Feeding" target="_blank">Matthew 14 (see notes)</a> when the 5,000+ were fed? Another feed miracle takes place from only seven loaves of bread and a few small fishes - with lots of leftovers.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this miracle, we see that Jesus took a ship to the other side of the Sea of Galilee when it is said in verse 39 that he &quot;came into the coasts of Magdala.&quot; Magdala was a city on the west coast of the Sea of Galilee (aka Sea of Tiberias). The events of this passage are immediately followed by those of <a title="Matthew 16; Mark 8 Summary" href="3-18.html#Top" target="_blank">Matthew 16; Mark 8:10-12 (see notes)</a>.</p>
