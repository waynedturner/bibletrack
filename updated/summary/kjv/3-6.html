7 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. <br>
8 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist&#146;s head in a charger. <br>
9 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath&#146;s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. <br>

16 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead. <br>
17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias&#146; sake, his brother Philip&#146;s wife: for he had married her. <br>
18 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother&#146;s wife. <br>
19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not: <br>
20 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. <br>
21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee; <br>
22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. <br>
23 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. <br>
24 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. <br>
25 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. <br>

<p><b>These actions regarding John the Baptist are history with regard to this passage.</b> That story is told in this passage to explain Herod's thinking at the time when he hears about the works of Jesus. He naturally thinks of John the Baptist, but at the same time he recognizes that he had already beheaded him. <b>Herod concludes that perhaps John the Baptist is resurrected.</b></p>
<p>Luke simply states the speculations regarding Jesus in relation to the belief that he might be John the Baptist, but Matthew and Mark go into great detail about the previous death of John the Baptist. These retrospective passages contain the only record we have on John's death.</p>

    <p>This is Herod Antipas, the son of Herod the Great (King Herod when Jesus was born). <b>Herod Antipas was ruler over the region in Northern Israel that included Galilee.</b> <b>This is the same Herod that declined to intercede in the trial of Jesus.</b> Herod's brother (Herod Philip), to whom Herodias had been married, was not a ruler. </p>
	<p><b>Here's what we know from first-century Jewish historian, Josephus:</b> After meeting Herodias on a trip to Rome, Herod Antipas divorced his wife, and Herodias divorced her husband (Philip, Herod Antipas' brother); the two subsequently married. </p>
		<p><b>John the Baptist had been very outspoken at this blatant disregard for Jewish law.</b> In this passage we see that after a night of birthday entertainment focused on the dancing of the daughter of his wife, he foolishly grants her a wish - a wish to include anything up to half his kingdom (he must have been drunk). After conferring with her mother, <b>the daughter requests John's head.</b> Matthew indicates that Herod would have executed John the Baptist early on had it not been for John's popularity with the Jewish people. According to Mark, however, <b>Herod had warmed up somewhat to John and had a lot of respect for him.</b> Obviously, Herodias had no tolerance whatsoever for John the Baptist. Immediately upon the request of the daughter of Herodias, <b>Herod sorrowfully sends an executioner to the prison and delivers to her John's head.</b></p>
		<p><b>Keep in mind, this story is told here in retrospect to explain Herod's thinking at the time when he became aware of the fame of Jesus. </b>He thought that perhaps John the Baptist had risen from the dead. Matthew and Mark, therefore, include this account to explain the fact that John the Baptist is no longer alive.</p>

<p><b>This account is found in all four Gospels.</b> Of the four Gospel writers, Matthew and John would have likely been the only ones actually present that day since they were numbered among the twelve Apostles; they had inside, first-hand knowledge of the events. <b>Though both were present, Matthew gives the shortest account while John goes into great detail.</b> John even mentions the names and conversations of the Apostles working on this feeding project. Remember John's mission as presented in <a href="6-30.html#Why" title="John 20 Summary" target="_blank">John 20:31 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.&quot; <b>John apparently wants to make certain that we understand the magnitude of this miracle of the feeding by carefully detailing all the relevant facts.</b> He does not want to generalize his account; details lend credibility. </p>
<p>Let's first of all get our bearings with regard to the time in Jesus' ministry when this event takes place. According to John 6:4, the Passover Feast is approaching. That Passover will be Jesus' last before his crucifixion on Passover day one year later. <b>Therefore, this event takes place just days before Jesus' last year of earthly ministry before his crucifixion.</b> You will notice that <strong>the venue here is a place near Bethsaida</strong>, but in order to secure some privacy, they take a ship to a desert place near the town. Even though Jesus and his disciples go by ship, the people follow by foot.</p>
	<p><b>The object here is the miracle, not the teaching</b> that brought them to that spot that day. Since they were out and away from provisions, they were faced with the choice of sending the people away early or feeding them. <b>Jesus feeds all 5,000+ people </b>(5,000 men plus women and children)<b> with five loaves of bread and two fish (small fish, according to John)</b>, and then ends up with leftovers - more than they started with. The significant verse of this occasion is found in John's account in John 6:14, &quot;Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, <b>This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</b>&quot; Their expectation of a prophet was based upon the words of Moses in <a title="Deuteronomy 18 Summary" href="4-12.html#Prophet" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 18:15-22 (see notes)</a>. So John uses this occasion to further validate that the people believed Jesus to be the Messiah.</p>
		<p>Incidentally, three of the four accounts tell us that Jesus healed the sick in the multitude that day prior to the feeding. Only Mark's account skips that detail. While all four accounts mention that the 5,000 number consisted of men, Matthew wants to make certain we understand that there were additional women and/or children there that day being fed also in 14:21. The accounts of Mark and John go into some additional detail regarding the dynamics of this feeding project. Mark tells us that upon the command of Jesus to feed the multitude, the disciples ask if Jesus wants them to go buy food - 200 pennyworth (Greek: denarion). How much is a denarion? We see in <a title="Matthew 20 Summary" href="4-27.html#Fair" target="_blank">Matthew 20:2 (see notes)</a> that a laborer worked one full day for a denarion. Whoa! That food bill would be equivalent to a man's wages for 200 days! John then reports that it was time for a little test for Philip when Jesus asks Philip where the food should be purchased (John 6:5-6). Philip responds to Jesus by saying that 200 denarion won't buy enough food for the multitude. In John 6:8-9 we see that it was Andrew (Peter's brother) who suggests that enough food might be distributed from the two fish and five loaves. Only John mentions the lad who owned the meager food supply. All four accounts are very specific to say that everyone ate enough to be full.</p>
