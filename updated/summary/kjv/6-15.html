<p>For the Philistines, their trouble has just begun with David now as King of Israel; they finally figure out that David is their enemy. Remember back in <a title="I Samuel 29 Summary" href="5-26.html#Achish" target="_blank">I Samuel 29 (see notes)</a> when David was being pursued by Saul? Among whom did he live? The Philistines! But now he's the king of the nation that is their enemy. David seemed to have gotten a honeymoon period while he was just King over Judah, but here they come against David now that he is King over all of Israel. David consults his battle planner, Jehovah (twice in this passage), and soundly defeats the Philistines in northern Judah. In the process of getting trounced by David's army, the Philistines left their idols behind; David and his men burn those idols. Then, on their second battle attempt against David, Jehovah instructs David to come up from behind them - BOOM! Battle over. <b>After those victories, we are told that the nations around Israel feared David and Israel.</b></p>
<p>We notice from II Samuel 5:25 and I Chronicles 14:16 that David's conquest did not include the city of Gezer. Later, the Egyptian Pharaoh conquered Gezer and gave it to Solomon as a dowry for his daughter in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=1&mo=8&dy=10#High" title="I Kings 9 Summary" target="_blank">I Kings 9:16 (see notes)</a>, Solomon's first wife on record.</p>

      2 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims. <br>
      3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. <br>
      4 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark. <br>
      5 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals. <br>
      6 And when they came to Nachon&rsquo;s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. <br>
      7 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God. <br>
      8 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day. <br>
      9 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me? <br>
      10 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. <br>
      11 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household. <br>
      12 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness. <br>

    <td align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#cce1ff" width="50%"><span class="style5">1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader. <br>
      2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: <br>
      3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul. <br>
      4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. <br>
      5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim. <br>
      6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it. <br>
      7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart. <br>
      8 And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. <br>
      9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. <br>
      10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. <br>
      11 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day. <br>
      12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me? <br>
      13 So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. <br>
    14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had. </span></td>

<p><span class="ds1">Let's transport the ark to it's new home in Jerusalem. </span>No...not the big boat - the Ark of the Covenant! It had resided at Shiloh during Eli's day (<a title="I Samuel 4 Summary" href="5-12.html#Plan" target="_blank">I Samuel 4, see notes</a>) before Israel decided to take it to battle against the Philistines when it was captured. Remember how much grief it gave the Philistines when they captured it (<a title="I Samuel 5 Summary" href="5-12.html#Hey" target="_blank">I Samuel 5, see notes</a>)? Well, Abinidab, a Levite, has been keeping it in his house since they got it back many years ago. It had been delivered by the Philistines to Abinadab at Kiriath Jearim about eight miles west of Jerusalem on the border between Benjamin and Judah. Saul made no attempt to have the ark returned to its proper home, but David sees the importance and determines to bring it to home...well...sort of home. </p>
<p><b>David wants the ark moved to his new capital city, Jerusalem.</b> The tabernacle built by Moses is actually set up in Gibeon at this point in time. David gets two professional ark movers to do the job, Abinidab's sons Ahio and Uzzah accompanied by 30,000 security guards. Oh, by the way David, there's a God-approved way to move the ark! But these &quot;professionals&quot; decide to haul it on a cart instead - bad mistake! Remember the specific instructions in <a title="Exodus 25 Summary" href="2-20.html#Ark" target="_blank">Exodus 25:12-15 (see notes)</a> regarding the exact procedures for moving the Ark? Well, the high-tech oxen-pulled cart is not in that passage. Leading the way - a big band even includes King David himself. When the cart begins to tip, Uzzah's there to steady it with his hand; he drops dead; that's no way to carry an ark! Discouraged at the incident and afraid of God, David parks the ark with a Levite for further consideration at a later time. That takes the wind out of that sail; David leaves it there at the house of Obededom the Gittite so he can regroup after this tragedy; it stays there for 3 months. Incidentally, the House of Obededom prospers as a result of the presence of the Ark (II Samuel 6:11; I Chronicles 13:14).</p>

14 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. <br>
15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. <br>
16 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul&rsquo;s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. <br>
17 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. <br>
18 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. <br>
19 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house. <br>
20 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! <br>
21 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD. <br>
22 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour. <br>

      3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it. <br>
      4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: <br>
      5 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: <br>
      6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: <br>
      7 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty: <br>
      8 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: <br>
      9 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: <br>
      10 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve. <br>
      11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, <br>
      12 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it. <br>
      13 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. <br>
      14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. <br>
      15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD. <br>
      16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. <br>
      17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; <br>
      18 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters. <br>
      19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass; <br>
      20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; <br>
      21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel. <br>
      22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful. <br>
      23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. <br>
      24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. <br>
      25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy. <br>
      26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. <br>
      27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen. <br>
      28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. <br>
    29 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. </span></td>

Oh, and most importantly, verse 15 says <b>they used the poles to carry it as they were supposed to in the first place. </b>One more thing, if we're going to move the ark, let's make it a celebration - complete with music. David tells the priests to get their brothers to be the musicians. David's having a big time of celebration when the Ark rolls into Jerusalem (pardon me; there was no &quot;rolling&quot; this time). </span></p>
<p><span class="ds3"><b>Michal, David's first wife and daughter of Saul, is not impressed. </b></span>After all, here's David dancin' in the streets around the Ark in only a linen ephod without his royal garments, and she's probably thinking, &quot;My Daddy would never have acted like that!&quot; Also remember that she had been taken away from David by Saul and had been given to another man. Afterward, David reclaimed her to be his wife when he was in a position of strength to do so back in <a title="II Samuel 3 Summary" href="5-28.html#Abner" target="_blank">II Samuel 3 (see notes)</a>. However, also recall when God told Saul through Samuel back in <a title="I Samuel 13 Summary" href="5-15.html#Saul" target="_blank">I Samuel 13:8-14 (see notes)</a> that his descendants would not inherit the throne? That's why these verses are so significant. While she once loved David, a lot has happened in between then and now. Now she's just critical; I Chronicles 15 simply reports in verse 29, &quot;she despised him in her heart.&quot; II Samuel 6:20 actually reports some of the insults she cast at David. <b>After David gives her his &quot;get over it&quot; speech, the passage states that she never bore children to David (verse 23), thus fulfilling the prophecy by Samuel in <a title="I Samuel 13 Summary" href="5-15.html#Saul" target="_blank">I Samuel 13:8-14 (see notes)</a> that Saul's descendants would have no part of the future throne.</b></p>
<p>We should take particular notice of verse 17, &quot;And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.&quot; <strong>David had built a new tabernacle in Jerusalem for the ark of the covenant.</strong> The other tabernacle is very, very old at this point in time and still resides in Gibeon according to I Chronicles 16:39-40 (<a href="#Celebration">see below</a>). We are not given any details regarding the construction of the new tabernacle. It obviously had an altar where sacrifices could be made as was done on this day.</p>
<p><a name="Celebration"></a><font size="4"><b>Then there's a big ol' the-ark-is-home celebration (I Chronicles 16)<br>
				</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style5">1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. <br>
    2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. <br>
    3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. <br>
    4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: <br>
    5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; <br>
    6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. <br>
    7 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. <br>
    8 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. <br>
    9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works. <br>
    10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. <br>
    11 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually. <br>
    12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; <br>
    13 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. <br>
    14 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth. <br>
    15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; <br>
    16 Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; <br>
    17 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, <br>
    18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; <br>
    19 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. <br>
    20 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people; <br>
    21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, <br>
    22 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. <br>
    23 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation. <br>
    24 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations. <br>
    25 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods. <br>
    26 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. <br>
    27 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place. <br>
    28 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. <br>
    29 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. <br>
    30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. <br>
    31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. <br>
    32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein. <br>
    33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. <br>
    34 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. <br>
    35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise. <br>
    36 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. <br>
    37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day&rsquo;s work required: <br>
    38 And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters: <br>
    39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon, <br>
    40 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; <br>
    41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; <br>
    42 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters. <br>
    43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the ark gets a home. When the job's done, David distributes food - a full meal to everyone. Then, the big song of thanksgiving - sung by his newly-formed men's ensemble headed up by Asaph. The song begins in verse 8 and ends in verse 36 with, &quot;Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.&quot; It's a song that recounts the covenant between God and Israel and invokes the names of Abraham and Jacob in the lyrics. The album goes super platinum - still being played today. Of course...when the king writes a song and has it sung by special singers before the people, what else are the song critics going to say? Job complete! The ark's now in Jerusalem!</p>
<p>It should be noted that verses 39-40 clearly indicate that the tabernacle is now residing in Gibeon. Since the ark had been removed from the tabernacle back in Eli's day (<a title="I Samuel 4 Summary" href="5-12.html#Plan" target="_blank">I Samuel 4, see notes</a>), it had never been returned there. And now...it's still not to be returned to the tabernacle, but instead resides in a special place in Jerusalem prepared by King David.</p>
