            2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. <br>
            3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. <br>
            4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up. <br>
            5 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. <br>
            6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims. <br>
            7 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. <br>
            8 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day. <br>
            9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. <br>
            10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, <br>

            13 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD; <br>

        <p><b>The Temple is complete.</b> This project began back in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?dy=4&mo=8#Temple" title="I Kings 5/II Chronicles 2 Summary" target="_blank">I Kings 5/II Chronicles 2 (see notes)</a>. Now we need to get the Ark of the Covenant into the new temple. You didn't casually move the Ark of the Covenant on a whim; people have died for such, as was the case with Uzzah <a title="II Samuel 6:1-15 Summary" href="6-15.html#Ark" target="_blank">(II Samuel 6:1-12; I Chronicles 13:1-14, see notes)</a>. </p>
        <p>It's time to kick into action all those musicians David appointed before his death. But first...everybody needs to be consecrated before God. We don't want any moving-the-ark mishaps this time. And so it was done - everybody consecrated who were involved in moving the ark. It's time to transport the Ark to its new home in the Holy of Holies. In order to undertake such an awesome responsibility, they show God their sincerity and willingness to obey with sacrifices, or as I Kings 8:5 says, &quot;...sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.&quot; Now that's a lot of sacrificing; must have worked, though - no deaths are recorded here. We see in II Chronicles 5:11 that all of the priests, regardless of course (<a title="I Chronicles 24 Summary" href="7-13.html#Shift" target="_blank">see notes on I Chronicles 24</a>), were involved in the move. </p>
        <p>And finally, <b>how do you know you've erected a house that God will actually indwell?</b> It's simple; look at II Chronicles 5:13-14. Remember that cloud by day back in the wilderness which represented God's presence? Well, here it is again - inside the new temple. I love it when a plan comes together.<b> It's the Shekinah Glory - filling the new temple!</b>  </p>

		<p><b>Hey! Something's missing here!</b> Look at II Chronicles 5:10, &quot;There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.&quot; The same statement of fact is found in I Kings 8:9. Has anyone seen Aaron's rod and that jar of manna we stuck in the ark back in <a title="Exodus 16 Summary" href="2-16.html#Stuff" target="_blank">Exodus 16:32-34 (see notes)</a>? It appears to be missing now. I suppose somewhere along the way those two items were removed; that's all we know.</p>

<p>Of all the people among whom God could have chosen to dwell, we're it. Of all the places in which God could have had a temple built, this is it. Solomon blesses the people of Jerusalem this day. As he speaks to the people of Israel, he reviews the provisions of the Davidic Covenant proclaiming that Israel is the nation of God and that the throne of David shall endure forever (<a href="6-19.html#Temple" title="II Samuel 7 Summary" target="_blank">II Samuel 7:12-16, see notes</a>). In his presentation, he points out that God had authorized the building of this new temple by David's son, Solomon himself.</p>

23 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart: <br>
24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day. <br>

26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. <br>
27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded? <br>
28 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day: <br>
29 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place. <br>
30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive. <br>
31 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house: <br>
32 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. <br>
33 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house: <br>
34 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers. <br>
35 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: <br>
36 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. <br>
37 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; <br>
38 What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: <br>

40 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. <br>
41 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name&rsquo;s sake; <br>
42 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house; <br>

44 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name: <br>
45 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. <br>
46 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near; <br>
47 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; <br>
48 And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: <br>
49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause, <br>
50 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them: <br>
51 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: <br>
52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee. <br>

26 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them; <br>
27 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance. <br>
28 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be: <br>
29 Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house: <br>

31 That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. <br>
32 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name&rsquo;s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house; <br>
33 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name. <br>
34 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name; <br>
35 Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. <br>
36 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near; <br>
37 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly; <br>
38 If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name: <br>
39 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee. <br>
40 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. <br>
41 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness. <br>
42 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant. </font></td>

</font>This is one of those covenant prayers - and a long prayer at that. <b>Solomon is well aware of the fact that Israel has lapses of service to the Lord from time to time; he includes that fact in his prayer of dedication.</b> He also makes an important statement in verse 46 when he prays, &quot;If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)...&quot; Of course, this is the cornerstone doctrine indicating the need for a Savior. <a title="Romans 3 Summary" href="8-13.html#Jews" target="_blank">Romans 3:23 (see notes)</a> says, &quot;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;&quot; <b>It is interesting, though, that Solomon, beginning in verse 46, seems to assume that his people will sin and fall into captivity because of their sin.</b> You will recall back in <a title="Deuteronomy 30 Summary" href="4-17.html" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 30 (see notes)</a> that Moses prophesied that Israel would, indeed, sin and fall into captivity. Solomon includes in his prayer the notion that Israel, after going into captivity, will once again turn back to the Lord; at this point in his prayer he calls upon God to forgive them when they repent while in captivity. </p>
<p>This fall and repentance was all part of the prophecy Moses had given in <a title="Deuteronomy 29 Summary" href="4-16.html#Warn" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 29-30 (see notes)</a>. It's interesting that Solomon simply accepts Moses' prophecy as a given reality, even though it has not taken place yet.<b> I'm guessing that it did not occur to Solomon that his own permission for his wives' pagan idols to be set up on the temple grounds would go a long way toward Israel's moral corruption and ultimate fall as indicated in </b><a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="8-18.html#Solomon" target="_blank"><b>I Kings 11:1-8 </b>(see notes)</a><b>.</b></p>

	<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">54 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. <br>
    55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, <br>
    56 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. <br>
    57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: <br>
    58 That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers. <br>
    59 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require: <br>
    60 That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else. <br>
    61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day. <br>

<p>No dedication is complete without a word to the people - a pep talk about doing right and a word of blessing upon the people of Israel. You will note Solomon's statement in verse 56 that God had fulfilled his promise to Israel through Moses inasmuch as they now have rest. This promise to Moses is seen in <a href="4-9.html#Worship" title="Deuteronomy 12 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 12:9 (see notes)</a>. Israel is to be God's show piece on earth to all the people of the world (verse 60).</p>

63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. <br>
64 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings. <br>
65 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. <br>
66 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people. </font></td>

7 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat. <br>
8 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt. <br>
9 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. <br>
10 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. <br>
11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king&rsquo;s house: and all that came into Solomon&rsquo;s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected. </font></td>

</font>Seven days of sacrificing? Whoaaa! They're breaking in the new altar - 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep in 7 days. To make room for the large numbers of sacrifices, the whole middle part of the court in front of the temple was consecrated. </p>
<p>This dedication was combined with the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Feasts.html" title="Jewish Feasts" target="_blank">see Feasts Table</a>). We see in verse 2 that they were gathered for their regular annual feast. It appears that they actually observed their Feast of Tabernacles for seven days and then the dedication of the new temple for an additional seven days. That clarification is seen when comparing verse 2 here with verses 65-66 and additionally considering the wording of II Chronicles 7:7-8.</p>
