	<p>Amaziah is Joash's (of Judah) boy. Judah was serious about the king being in the royal line of King David. <b>Twenty-five-year-old Amaziah was good in that he got rid of the high places and idol worship for himself, but did not rid Judah of these pagan places of worship. </b>He couldn't quite get past the fact that his father had been killed by his own servants (<a title="II Kings 12; II Chronicles 24 Summary" href="9-5.html#Joash" target="_blank">II Kings 12:17-21; II Chronicles 24:20-27, see notes</a>) - even though his Dad was a rascal.

However, he had respect for the Law of Moses (<a title="Deuteronomy 24 Summary" href="4-14.html#Once" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 24:16, see notes</a>) in that he did not slay the children of the assassins.

<p>Amaziah had a big army - 300,000 strong. Feeling he needed more, he employs another 100,000 soldiers from his sister country, Israel. When the (unspecified) prophet comes to tell him that God's not happy with the use of these mercenaries, he dismisses them, apparently with full pay. <b>Amaziah's army does well - has a big victory over the Edomites.</b> He seems to violate the modern-day stipulations of the Geneva Convention in verse 12 when he takes 10,000 of those Edomites to the top of a mountain and throws them off. </p>
<p>By the way, remember the army he dismissed comprised of mercenary soldiers from the Northern Kingdom, Israel? Well, that army turns on him and plunders some of the cities of Judah (killing 3,000) while he's out fighting Edom. II Chronicles refers to these Edomites as the &quot;children of Seir,&quot; a reference to the mountain range upon which the Edomites lived. <a href="8-31.html#Edom" title="Obadiah Summary" target="_blank">For a complete look at the Edomites, click here.</a></p>

    15 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand? <br>
    16 And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king&rsquo;s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is it about kings and their gods? <b>Amaziah started out right, but upon his return from the land of the Edomites, he brings back some of their gods...and makes them his own.</b> God sends a prophet (unspecified) to try to reason with him, but he just won't hear it. I particularly like the line the prophet gives Amaziah, &quot;Why have you adopted the gods of a people who couldn't even protect them in battle against you?&quot; Good point! The prophet issues his prophecy to Amaziah, &quot;I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.&quot; Whoa! You gotta hate to get news like that!</p>
<p>So...Amaziah starts out his reign by serving God, but later begins serving the idols of the conquered Edomites - go figure! Can anything good now come out of a man who makes such a U-turn in his spiritual life. NO!</p>

  <p>After his successful campaign against the Edomites, Amaziah is ready to take on Israel. Apparently he had his eye on the legacy of a united Israel once again - all twelve tribes together as one nation. Joash (aka Jehoash, King of Israel) doesn't want to go to war with Judah - tries to reason with him about war between them, but Amaziah is determined. Perhaps the analogy Joash used in his discussions with Amaziah made him more determined. In the analogy, Joash compares Judah to a thistle and Israel to a full-grown tree. The thistle wants to take the tree as his wife. That analogy, with Judah as the male head of the marriage relationship, shows that Joash understands Amaziah's intentions to be the head over a restored, united kingdom. Only problem - the analogy concludes with a wild beast inadvertently trampling down the insignificant thistle. Reading between the lines, the analogy cries out, &quot;What...are you crazy!&quot; </p>
  <p>Despite the warning, <b>Joash meets Amaziah about 15 miles west of Jerusalem in <font size="3">Bethshemesh</font> and soundly beats him.</b> Then Joash feels he has to come to Jerusalem to teach Amaziah a hard lesson. He takes hostages, valuables and even tears down some of the wall around Jerusalem in the process. The &quot;gate of Ephraim&quot; (verse 13) indicates that a portion of the wall was destroyed on the northern side of the city, making them vulnerable to attack from the north after that. Amaziah's son, Uzziah, repairs this breach and fortifies the walls later in <a href="9-9.html#Success" title="II Chronicles 26 Summary" target="_blank">II Chronicles 26:9 (see notes)</a>.</p>
  <p>Amaziah is taken prisoner by Joash, King of Israel. He apparently is released from captivity and continues to rule over Judah...outlives Joash by 15 years. Finally, Amaziah is forced to flee Jerusalem to Lachish (about 30 miles southwest), but is captured and executed by his own people. Tough end for a guy who started out with such promise. He is counted worthy by his own people to be buried with his ancestors. Amaziah's sixteen-year-old son, Azariah, is made King of Judah after his father's execution.</p>
  <p><a name="Jeroboam"></a><font size="4"><b>And finally...one more Jeroboam (II Kings 14:23-29)</b></font><br>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years. <br>
    24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. <br>
    25 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher. <br>
    26 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel. <br>
    27 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. <br>
    28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <br>
    29 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thought you had your fill of Jeroboams? Hold on; there's one more; he's known as Jeroboam II - King of Israel for 41 years. Any chance he'll serve the true God? Nope - no chance. He lives up to his namesake. He had some successes against Syria - actually restored a good bit of real estate back under the control of the Northern Kingdom and leaves a relatively strong kingdom before his death, but he didn't serve God. A significant point of reference is seen in verse 25 where we see mention of &quot;Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet.&quot; From this we know <font size="3">that Jonah prophesied during the reign of Jeroboam II (793-753 B.C.) in Israel. <a title="Jonah Summary" href="9-8.html" target="_blank">Click here to go to the notes on the Book of Jonah.</a></font></p>
  <p><b>The Expositor's Bible Commentary has some interesting insight on verses 27-29:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Because Israel had fallen into such desperate spiritual conditions (vv.26-27), a merciful God had acted on behalf of his people. As he had granted them deliverance from external pressures by sending Adad-Nirari III of Assyria against the Arameans (cf. 13:5, 22-23) initiating a period of recovery under Jehoash (13:25; 14:14-15), so now in a grander way he culminated that deliverance with full victory over the Arameans, one that included Israel&#146;s recovery of its former boundaries (vv.27-28).</p>
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Despite the evil ways of Jeroboam and the Northern Kingdom, Israel, God had mercy upon them and determined that he would not &quot;blot out the name of Israel from under heaven.&quot; Like it or not, sometimes God gives successes to bad people for reasons that have nothing to do with the bad people themselves.</p>
