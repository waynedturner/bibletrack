	<blockquote>
	  <p align="left"><font size="2">1 Of the blue, purple, and scarlet thread they made garments of ministry, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
2 &para; He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine woven linen. <br />
3 And they beat the gold into thin sheets and cut it into threads, to work it in with the blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and the fine linen, into artistic designs. <br />
4 They made shoulder straps for it to couple it together; it was coupled together at its two edges. <br />
5 And the intricately woven band of his ephod that was on it was of the same workmanship, woven of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine woven linen, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
6 &para; And they set onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold; they were engraved, as signets are engraved, with the names of the sons of Israel. <br />
7 He put them on the shoulders of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
8 &para; And he made the breastplate, artistically woven like the workmanship of the ephod, of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine woven linen. <br />
9 They made the breastplate square by doubling it; a span was its length and a span its width when doubled. <br />
10 And they set in it four rows of stones: a row with a sardius, a topaz, and an emerald was the first row; <br />
11 the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond; <br />
12 the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; <br />
13 the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in settings of gold in their mountings. <br />
14 There were twelve stones according to the names of the sons of Israel: according to their names, engraved like a signet, each one with its own name according to the twelve tribes. <br />
15 And they made chains for the breastplate at the ends, like braided cords of pure gold. <br />
16 They also made two settings of gold and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. <br />
17 And they put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. <br />
18 The two ends of the two braided chains they fastened in the two settings, and put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod in the front. <br />
19 And they made two rings of gold and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge of it, which was on the inward side of the ephod. <br />
20 They made two other gold rings and put them on the two shoulder straps, underneath the ephod toward its front, right at the seam above the intricately woven band of the ephod. <br />
21 And they bound the breastplate by means of its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it would be above the intricately woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate would not come loose from the ephod, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
22 &para; He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. <br />
23 And there was an opening in the middle of the robe, like the opening in a coat of mail, with a woven binding all around the opening, so that it would not tear. <br />
24 They made on the hem of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet, and of fine woven linen.<br />
25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates on the hem of the robe all around between the pomegranates: <br />
26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the robe to minister in, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
27 &para; They made tunics, artistically woven of fine linen, for Aaron and his sons, <br />
28 a turban of fine linen, exquisite hats of fine linen, short trousers of fine woven linen, <br />
29 and a sash of fine woven linen with blue, purple, and scarlet thread, made by a weaver, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
30 &para; Then they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription like the engraving of a signet:<br />
HOLINESS TO THE LORD. <br />
31 And they tied to it a blue cord, to fasten it above on the turban, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />

	  <p><font size="2">32 &para; Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished. And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did. <br />
33 And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; <br />
34 the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of badger skins, and the veil of the covering; <br />

	<p>You know that feeling of dread you have when you receive a piece of furniture that is tightly compacted into a flat box labeled &quot;<b>Some assembly required</b>&quot;? Imagine how Moses must have felt when the contractors roll up to his tent door with the news that they're all done, &quot;And here's your Tabernacle.&quot; Assembled? No! There it is in ready-to-assemble pieces all over his front yard. The delivery included the furniture as well as the priests' clothing...everything. Not a problem for Moses though; look at Exodus 39:43, &quot;Then Moses looked over all the work, and indeed they had done it; as the LORD had commanded, just so they had done it. And Moses blessed them.&quot; </p>

2 &ldquo;On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. <br />
3 You shall put in it the ark of the Testimony, and partition off the ark with the veil. <br />
4 You shall bring in the table and arrange the things that are to be set in order on it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and light its lamps. <br />
5 You shall also set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the Testimony, and put up the screen for the door of the tabernacle. <br />
6 Then you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. <br />
7 And you shall set the laver between the tabernacle of meeting and the altar, and put water in it. <br />
8 You shall set up the court all around, and hang up the screen at the court gate. <br />
9 &para; &ldquo;And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it; and you shall hallow it and all its utensils, and it shall be holy. <br />
10 You shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar. The altar shall be most holy. <br />
11 And you shall anoint the laver and its base, and consecrate it. <br />
12 &para; &ldquo;Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of meeting and wash them with water. <br />
13 You shall put the holy garments on Aaron, and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may minister to Me as priest. <br />
14 And you shall bring his sons and clothe them with tunics. <br />
15 You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to Me as priests; for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.&rdquo; <br />

	<p align="left"><font size="3">It's not everyday that you take delivery of a Tabernacle. So...how long has it been since they left Egypt? It has been just two weeks short of one year - nine months since they arrive at Mount Sinai. According to verses 2 and 17, it appears from the text that it only took Moses one day to assemble everything. I'm guessing he had help. In these 15 verses we see that God gives specific instructions to Moses on when to start assembling it and how to proceed.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><b>Here are those instructions:</b></p>
	<ul>
      <li><b>Set it up</b> (Exodus 40:1-8) </li>
	  <li><b>Anoint it</b> (Exodus 40:9-11) </li>
	  <li><b>Bring in the priests and anoint them</b> (Exodus 40:12-15)<br />
	    The priesthood consisted of five people, Aaron and his four sons. Aaron was the high priest. </li>
    </ul>
	<p align="left">We actually don't see the appointment of Levites to assist the priests until <a title="Numbers 3 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=3&amp;dy=15#Levites" target="_blank">Numbers 3 (see notes)</a>. At this point in time the firstborn of the families were the consecrated ones.  We are not told who actually assisted Moses in the setup.</p>

	  <p align="left"><font size="2">16 &para; Thus Moses did; according to all that the LORD had commanded him, so he did. <br />
17 &para; And it came to pass in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up. <br />
18 So Moses raised up the tabernacle, fastened its sockets, set up its boards, put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. <br />
19 And he spread out the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
20 He took the Testimony and put it into the ark, inserted the poles through the rings of the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark. <br />
21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, hung up the veil of the covering, and partitioned off the ark of the Testimony, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
22 &para; He put the table in the tabernacle of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil; <br />
23 and he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
24 He put the lampstand in the tabernacle of meeting, across from the table, on the south side of the tabernacle; <br />
25 and he lit the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
26 He put the gold altar in the tabernacle of meeting in front of the veil; <br />
27 and he burned sweet incense on it, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
28 He hung up the screen at the door of the tabernacle. <br />
29 And he put the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
30 He set the laver between the tabernacle of meeting and the altar, and put water there for washing; <br />
31 and Moses, Aaron, and his sons would wash their hands and their feet with water from it. <br />
32 Whenever they went into the tabernacle of meeting, and when they came near the altar, they washed, as the LORD had commanded Moses. <br />
33 And he raised up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the screen of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. <br />
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font size="3">So, how long does it take to build a Tabernacle like this? Here's what we know. God told Moses to assemble the Tabernacle on a date that marked their one-year anniversary of freedom from Egypt. Well, technically, the Passover and release didn't take place until the 14th day of the month and this assembly date is on the first day of the first month of the second year. It took them three months to reach their current location at Sinai. Moses spent 80 days up on the mountain talking with God. <b>That left about six months to do the work.</b> I don't know how long it stayed in Moses' yard before assembly, but with the assembly orchestrated to take place fourteen days before the Passover, it would appear that the workers must have been on a carefully-timed schedule for finishing the project. We aren't told who helped erect the tabernacle, but since it only took one day to assemble, he certainly had laborers to assist. You'll notice that the new laver of the Tabernacle gets a good workout for the ceremonial washings, Aaron and his sons in verse 12.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font size="4"><b><a name="Presence"></a>The final component: God's presence (Exodus 40:34-38)</b></font><br />
        </p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p align="left"> <font size="2">34 &para; Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. <br />
35 And Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of meeting, because the cloud rested above it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. <br />
36 Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle, the children of Israel would go onward in all their journeys. <br />
37 But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not journey till the day that it was taken up. <br />
38 For the cloud of the LORD was above the tabernacle by day, and fire was over it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys. </font> </p>
    </blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font size="3">So what makes this Tabernacle so special? Here it is - the presence of God. Nobody goes in (including Moses) when God is there. His appearance was in the form of a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night; we know this as the Shekinah Glory. <a title="The Shekinah Glory" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Shekinah_glory.html" target="_blank">Click here for more details on the Shekinah Glory.</a> When it would stay, Israel would stay; when it would move, Israel would move. Israel was never lost in the wilderness. <b>They were always in the exact location where God wanted them; his presence among them proves that.</b></font></p>
