		<p><font size="3"><b>Big-time judges of others - that's what the Pharisees and Sadducees were...and mean spirited too!</b> They were quick to point out the least little infraction of the Law, but were blatant violators of the very spirit of the Law (as we saw in <a title="Matthew 5; Luke 6 Summary" href="2-2.html#Beatitudes" target="_blank">Matthew 5, see notes</a>). As a matter of fact, Jesus mentions the Pharisees by name in this discourse in Matthew 5:20 when he says, &quot;For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.&quot; Jesus points out that<b> they are not qualified to pass judgment on others because of this. </b>Notice what Jesus says about them in Luke 6:39, &quot;Can the blind lead the blind?&quot; That's also the point of the analogy Jesus gives regarding the small splinter in one's eye (the one being judged) compared to the giant plank in the eye of another (the one doing the judging).</font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Let's itemize the concepts that Jesus touches in this grouping of verses from both perspectives - Matthew and Luke:</b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Pharisees and Sadducees are about judging, not ministering (Matthew 7:1; Luke 6:37).
			<li>Judgment and forgiveness will be returned to one in the same proportion extended (Matthew 7:2; Luke 6:38).
			<li>An analogy is given regarding blindness as the result of an obstacle in one's eye (Matthew 7:3-5; Luke 6:39-42).
			<li>These Jewish leaders are like scavengers (dogs, pigs) who can't be trusted with spiritual things (Matthew 7:6).
		</ul>
		<p><font size="3"><b>This passage has suffered significant abuse by the live-and-let-live crowd.</b> They particularly like to isolate verse 1, &quot;Judge not, that you be not judged.&quot; (Isn't it amazing how many people have memorized that verse?) <b>Pulling it completely out of the context in which Jesus spoke these words, they use it to criticize those who take a stand for righteousness among those who flaunt their sin.</b> The point here is that the Pharisees practiced a false, high-profile, in-your-face righteousness. <b>The Pharisees were, in fact, corrupt - not righteous.</b> That's the context in which Jesus accused these Pharisees regarding their quick-to-judge practices. In fact, <b>Believers are to take a stand for righteousness and shun Believers who practice sin.</b> You can clearly see that principle in <a title="I Corinthians 5 Summary" href="8-29.html#Corinthians" target="_blank">I Corinthians 5:11 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner&mdash;not even to eat with such a person.&quot; But be careful; make certain that, while you're separating yourself from Christians practicing wickedness, you don't have glaring inconsistencies in your own Christian testimony.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Luke 6:38 has also been much misused</b> by many of those who raise money for their own broadcast ministries. Verse 38 says, &quot;Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you.&quot; In this same judge-not context, <b>Jesus is telling the people that they should be generous with people instead of judging them.</b> This is not a verse on giving your tithes and offerings to the church or any other ministry. As a matter of fact, Matthews rendition of this verse is here in verse 2, &quot;For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.&quot; When you read it in the context of the passage, it is plain to see the sense in which Jesus said those words. As a matter of fact, money doesn't appear to be the object of this verse at all; it's forgiveness along with friendly assistance - obviously so when you compare both accounts (Matthew and Luke). For additional insight regarding the point of this verse, read the section below on Matthew 7:7-12 (<a href="#Generosity">see below</a>).</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Only slightly veiled, Jesus compares the Jewish leaders to blind people leading others, and to scavengers (Matthew 7:3-6; Luke 6:39-42). While we tend to read right through these verses without realizing the full impact on the audience, there must have been at least a few red-faced Jewish leaders in the crowd that day as Jesus was speaking.</font></p>

		<p><b>It's interesting to note that these six verses (7-12) on prayer are really given as an analogy to illustrate the point of verses 1-6</b> where Jesus is talking about being generous, not judgmental toward others. In other words, just as God is generous toward us as his children, we should be generous toward others. That's the point Luke emphasizes from this monologue by Jesus in Luke 6:38, and you can see it as well in Matthew 7:12 when Jesus says, &quot;Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.&quot; </p>
	<p>In the process of making this point, however, Jesus points out that <font size="3"><b>God wants to meet our needs.</b> Jesus here emphasizes the conversational aspect of prayer. He's referring to a comfort level that every Believer should have with God that causes them to stay in a constant state of prayer - asking, seeking and knocking. Jesus further compares that to how parents answer the persistent petitions of their own children. <b>So...here's the point: Just as God loves us and wants the best for us, we should love others and want the best for them.</b> When that is our attitude toward others, it will come back at us proportionately.</font> And...with regard to persistent, conversational prayer with God, Paul has much to say on the issue to Believers on the subject when he says in <a href="10-20.html#Pointers" title="I Thessalonians 5 Summary" target="_blank">I Thessalonians 5:17 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Pray without ceasing.&quot; He likewise instructs another church in <a href="10-16.html#Continual" title="Colossians 4 Summary" target="_blank">Colossians 4:2 (see notes)</a> when he says, &quot;Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving.&quot;</p>
	<p>These comments are similar to those made by Jesus again much later in his ministry and recorded in <a href="3-30.html#Prayer" title="Luke 11 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 11:1-10 (see notes)</a>.</p>

<p>I think that if you had been a Pharisee sitting there that day, verses 13 and 14 would have cut you to the quick. To whom do you suppose Jesus is referring as he warns against those who are taking this &quot;broad way to destruction,&quot; the Sadducees and Pharisees? We know that Jesus had NO respect for their manufactured religious practices. It's the same today. The popular &quot;religious&quot; crowd presents the &quot;broad way&quot; while Jesus says in <a title="John 14 Summary" href="5-29.html#Way" target="_blank">John 14:6 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.'&quot; That's the &quot;narrow way.&quot;</p>
<p>There are those who SAY they subscribe to the precepts of scripture, but who also are open to the value of other contrary religions...alternative means whereby one might supposedly obtain eternal life. As a matter of fact, <b>Evangelical Christians are often demeaned and even ridiculed for taking the position that one can only go to Heaven by trusting Jesus Christ as one's savior.</b> When faced with intense questioning on my position, I simply quote <a title="John 14 Summary" href="5-29.html#Way" target="_blank">John 14:6 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.'&quot; It simply cannot be stated more clearly...requires no explaining or interpretation; it is what it is. There's nothing like quoting the clear words of Jesus when answering questions on eternal life.</p>

		<p>Now for the transition from the &quot;broad way to destruction.&quot; (<a href="#Road">see verses 13-14</a>) Could it be that here Jesus is <b>calling these Jewish leaders false prophets?</b> Well, let's see, &quot;You will know them by their fruits...&quot; (verse 16). <b>Jesus has been talking about their fruits; they were corrupt (they faked their righteousness).</b> As a matter of fact, Jesus mentions the Pharisees in this discourse in <a href="2-2.html#Declaration" title="Matthew 5 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 5:20 (see notes)</a> when he says, &quot;<font size="3">For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</font>&quot; <b>Everyone agrees that the fruits of a false prophet are corrupt because of spiritual corruption.</b> And what happens to those who are spiritually corrupt? See verse 19 (hewn down and cast into the fire), and just analyze the fruit (verse 20). <b>Isn't it just classic Jesus how he was able to categorize these Jewish leaders with the false prophets without actually saying so directly?</b> You should notice that Matthew 7:15-20 corresponds to Luke 6:43-45 from two different accounts of the same message that day. <b>The in-your-face application for this corrupt-fruit analogy is found in Matthew 7:21-23 and Luke 6:46; since Matthew was more graphic and detailed with his rendition of the closer, let's consider his words here:</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Not everyone who says to Me, &quot;Lord, Lord,&quot; shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, &quot;Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?&quot; And then I will declare to them, &quot;<strong>I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!</strong>&quot; (Matthew 7:21-23)</p>
  </blockquote>
	<p>But these Jewish leaders had really, really good resumes, right? Oooooo! <b>Look again at verses 21-23; a lot of religious people are in for a surprise! Could it be that a righteous-looking resume isn't what God is looking for? God is looking for a heart surrendered to Him</b><b>.</b> Even though these Jewish leaders appeared as &quot;sheep,&quot; they were actually &quot;wolves&quot; who did not have the best interests of the common, everyday Jews in mind. Hmmmmm...is Jesus really calling these very religious leaders &quot;wolves?&quot; Absolutely! To verify, let's look closely at the wording of Luke 6:46, &quot;<font size="3">But why do you call Me &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; and not do the things which I say?&quot;</font> Both verbs &quot;call&quot; (Greek: kaleo) and &quot;do&quot; (Greek: poieo) are second person plural verbs, the equivalent of our southern expressions &quot;y'all call&quot; and &quot;y'all do.&quot; In short, Jesus is actually addressing the guilty people of this passage right there in his audience.</p>
	<p>One more thing: notice <b>Luke 6:45</b>, &quot;A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.&quot; That corresponds to the message of <b>Holy Spirit leadership</b> of Believers in <a title="Galatians 5 Summary" href="9-30.html#Key" target="_blank"><b>Galatians 5:22-23</b> (see notes)</a>, &quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.&quot; The very condemnatory words of the Jewish leaders in Jesus' day were actually self condemning. Evil men speak evil things; God-led men speak godly things; it's just that simple.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>In conclusion, a warning about heeding what they had heard (Matthew 7:24-29; Luke 6:47-49)</b></font><br>

		<p>Jesus' message was packed full of spiritual indicators. So here's the invitation: Do you go on as you were, or will you respond to the call for true holiness, a holiness of the heart? Notice what Matthew says about the teaching of Jesus on this occasion in verse 29, &quot;for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.&quot;<b> Jesus gave them house-built-on-a-rock teaching as opposed to the house-built-on-sand teaching of the professional teachers, the scribes.</b></p>
	<p><b>If it needs to spelled out more clearly, here it is: The Jewish leaders were religious, but had no foundation for their religious practice. Jesus is issuing an invitation to establish one's faith on the rock of the truth of God's Word through Jesus Christ.</b></p>
