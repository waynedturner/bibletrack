<p><font size="3">For those Believers today who still believe that we are supposed to keep the Law of Moses as Believers, try this chapter on for size. Leviticus 11 gives us a list of foods that the Hebrews were permitted to eat, and another list that they were not. If you have Jewish acquaintances, you may hear them refer to <b>&quot;kosher&quot; foods.</b> &quot;Kosher&quot; or &quot;Kashrut&quot; comes from the Hebrew word &quot;kaw-share&acute;,&quot; which means fit, proper or correct. The word &quot;kosher&quot; can also be used, and often is used, to describe ritual objects that are made in accordance with Jewish law and are fit for ritual use. Here's a breakdown on food as practiced by observant Jews today based upon a combination of Old Testament Law and Rabbinical tradition:</font></p>

<p><b>You will notice in the list above that some of the foods mentioned are not found in Leviticus 11.</b> For that reason, many Messianic Christians today support the observance of Kosher laws as specified in scripture, but not those foods which are not specified in scripture. This practice is referred to as &quot;Torah Kosher,&quot; to be contrasted with &quot;Rabbinical Kosher&quot; as specified in the list above. This larger list of foods came about through rabbinical tradition rather than Old Testament scripture. You will also find the list of clean/unclean foods in <a title="Deuteronomy 14 Summary" href="4-10.html#Food" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 14:3-21 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, <b>the word &quot;abomination&quot; is used ten times</b> in this passage with regard to the eating of certain foods. That's an interesting problem for those who insist that we (Gentiles) are responsible for keeping God's law given to the Hebrews and yet do not follow these guidelines on diet.</p>
<p>This designation of meat that is &quot;unclean&quot; is not new here. You will recall that Adam and Eve apparently started out as vegetarians (<a title="Genesis 1 Summary" href="1-2.html#Six" target="_blank">Genesis 1:29-30, see notes</a>). Yet, when Noah was loading the ark with animals, God gave specific ark-loading instructions to Noah regarding &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;unclean&quot; animals in <a title="Genesis 7 Summary" href="1-3.html#Time" target="_blank">Genesis 7:2 (see notes)</a>. It's actually not until after the ark experience that we see the first occurrence of a meat diet per God's instructions in <a title="Genesis 9 Summary" href="1-4.html#Covenant" target="_blank">Genesis 9:2-3 (see notes)</a> as part of the Noahic Covenant. So...the differentiation of which animals are okay to eat or not actually goes back to Noah.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">And...don't even touch these things! (Leviticus 11:24-40)</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">24 &para; &ldquo;By these you shall become unclean; whoever touches the carcass of any of them shall be unclean until evening; <br />
25 whoever carries part of the carcass of any of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening: <br />
26 The carcass of any animal which divides the foot, but is not cloven-hoofed or does not chew the cud, is unclean to you. Everyone who touches it shall be unclean. <br />
27 And whatever goes on its paws, among all kinds of animals that go on all fours, those are unclean to you. Whoever touches any such carcass shall be unclean until evening. <br />
28 Whoever carries any such carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. It is unclean to you. <br />
29 &para; &ldquo;These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the mole, the mouse, and the large lizard after its kind; <br />
30 the gecko, the monitor lizard, the sand reptile, the sand lizard, and the chameleon. <br />
31 These are unclean to you among all that creep. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening. <br />
32 Anything on which any of them falls, when they are dead shall be unclean, whether it is any item of wood or clothing or skin or sack, whatever item it is, in which any work is done, it must be put in water. And it shall be unclean until evening; then it shall be clean. <br />
33 Any earthen vessel into which any of them falls you shall break; and whatever is in it shall be unclean: <br />
34 in such a vessel, any edible food upon which water falls becomes unclean, and any drink that may be drunk from it becomes unclean. <br />
35 And everything on which a part of any such carcass falls shall be unclean; whether it is an oven or cooking stove, it shall be broken down; for they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you. <br />
36 Nevertheless a spring or a cistern, in which there is plenty of water, shall be clean, but whatever touches any such carcass becomes unclean. <br />
37 And if a part of any such carcass falls on any planting seed which is to be sown, it remains clean. <br />
38 But if water is put on the seed, and if a part of any such carcass falls on it, it becomes unclean to you. <br />
39 &para; &ldquo;And if any animal which you may eat dies, he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until evening. <br />
40 He who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. He also who carries its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. <br />
  </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>It's also interesting to note that the Hebrews are told that they are considered unclean until evening if they even touch the carcase of an unclean animal. That instruction first appears in this chapter in verse 8, but is repeated with great detail in verse 24-40. That means that for the remainder of the day after touching the carcase of an unclean animal, the Hebrew was not to make physical contact with another Hebrew - not until that day had passed. </p>
<p>You will also notice the discussion of unclean animals coming into contact with vessels. The considerations in view here revolve around whether or not the vessels have porousity and whether or not they are wet or dry. These very detailed regulations are provided as guidelines to prevent their cookware from absorbing the impurities of unclean animals.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="Wrap"></a>The wrap up on unclean animals (Leviticus 11:41-47)</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">41 &para; &ldquo;And every creeping thing that creeps on the earth shall be an abomination. It shall not be eaten. <br />
42 Whatever crawls on its belly, whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet among all creeping things that creep on the earth&mdash;these you shall not eat, for they are an abomination. <br />
43 You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps; nor shall you make yourselves unclean with them, lest you be defiled by them. <br />
44 For I am the LORD your God. You shall therefore consecrate yourselves, and you shall be holy; for I am holy. Neither shall you defile yourselves with any creeping thing that creeps on the earth. <br />
45 For I am the LORD who brings you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy. <br />
46 &para; &ldquo;This is the law of the animals and the birds and every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps on the earth, <br />
47 to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, and between the animal that may be eaten and the animal that may not be eaten.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These last seven verses of chapter 11 make a strong emphasis regarding the importance of these unclean-animal mandates. You can see how much emphasis is placed upon them for the Hebrews - an inseparable part of the Mosaic Law. Peter actually quotes from Leviticus 11:44-45 when he says in <a href="11-25.html#You" title="I Peter 1 Summary" target="_blank">I Peter 1:15-16 (see notes)</a> &quot;but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct,  because it is written, 'Be holy, for I am holy.'&quot;</p>
<p><a name="Childbearing"></a><font size="4"><b>For the women: Childbearing with a slight twist (Leviticus 12)</b></font><br>
			</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <br />
2 &ldquo;Speak to the children of Israel, saying: &lsquo;If a woman has conceived, and borne a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her customary impurity she shall be unclean. <br />
3 And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. <br />
4 She shall then continue in the blood of her purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purification are fulfilled. <br />
5 &para; &ldquo;But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her customary impurity, and she shall continue in the blood of her purification sixty-six days. <br />
6 &para; &ldquo;When the days of her purification are fulfilled, whether for a son or a daughter, she shall bring to the priest a lamb of the first year as a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of meeting. <br />
7 Then he shall offer it before the LORD, and make atonement for her. And she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who has borne a male or a female. <br />
8 &para; &ldquo;And if she is not able to bring a lamb, then she may bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons&mdash;one as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br />
          </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><font size="3">You'll notice that the period of ceremonial uncleanness (no contact with sacred things) for the Hebrew woman <b>after bearing a male child was 40 days, but 80 days after bearing a female child;</b> we don't know why the difference. You'll also notice that during the first 7 days for a male child and 14 days for a female, no contact was to be made by the mother with others whatsoever; <b>she was considered altogether unclean.</b> </font></p>
		<p><font size="3">It seems apparent that God gave the Jews a heads-up on a disease that claimed the lives of as many as 20% of all women who bore children prior to the 19th century; this disease was called <b>&quot;childbed fever&quot;</b> back then, and today is known as  <b>&quot;puerperal fever.&quot;</b> It was observed that women who were isolated from others (i.e. home deliveries) rarely were infected, but women who went to a hospital for delivery had the highest incident of death from this disease. After extended research in the 19th century by the Hungarian doctor, Ignaz Semmelweiz, on the disease, he was able to determine that <b>it was the contact with others after childbirth that caused the women to contract an infection which was often fatal.</b> He discovered that the use of soap and water was not sufficient to remove dangerous bacteria from the hands of hospital staff caring for these women after childbirth. The greater the contact of these new mothers with people, the greater likelihood they had of contracting this disease. The extended period of ceremonial uncleanness for the women after the 7 or 14 days of total isolation was probably as much for the benefit of the child as for the mother. During this extended period her contact with others in public places was significantly reduced, even though she was not totally isolated.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">This disease, puerperal fever, still exists today, though uncommon due to the use of anti-bacterial soaps and gloves. However, millennia before the use of special soaps and gloves, <b>God knew that the best way to protect moms and babies was to just keep them isolated for several days after childbirth.</b> It is ironic that in order to do so, the women were declared to be &quot;unclean&quot; and not the actual unclean people. Whatever...the moms were protected.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3">This child-bearing sacrifice at the end of the 40 or 80 days substantially increased the work load of the priests. If you consider the sacrifices given here to be made by the mother after bearing a child based on the estimated number of women bearing children during that period (600,000 or so women), you can imagine how busy the priests were at the Tabernacle for just this sacrifice alone. Let's face it: priesting was an all-day, tedious job!</font></p>
		<p>At the end of the purification days, she brought a sacrifice to the priest to complete her cleansing process. The offering was to be a lamb, or in the case of those who were poor, two &quot;turtledoves&quot; (aka doves) or two pigeons. Incidentally, we see in <a href="1-9.html#Trip" title="Luke 2 Summary" target="_blank">Luke 2:24 (see notes)</a> that Joseph and Mary brought birds to sacrifice after the birth of Jesus instead of a lamb. This speaks to the fact that Joseph and Mary were not people of wealth.</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: <br />
  2 &ldquo;When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling, a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes on the skin of his body like a leprous sore, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests. <br />
	        3 The priest shall examine the sore on the skin of the body; and if the hair on the sore has turned white, and the sore appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous sore. Then the priest shall examine him, and pronounce him unclean. <br />
	        4 But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the priest shall isolate the one who has the sore seven days. <br />

	        14 But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean. <br />

	        33 he shall shave himself, but the scale he shall not shave. And the priest shall isolate the one who has the scale another seven days. <br />
	        34 On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scale; and indeed if the scale has not spread over the skin, and does not appear deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean. <br />
	        35 But if the scale should at all spread over the skin after his cleansing, <br />
	        36 then the priest shall examine him; and indeed if the scale has spread over the skin, the priest need not seek for yellow hair. He is unclean. <br />
	        37 But if the scale appears to be at a standstill, and there is black hair grown up in it, the scale has healed. He is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean. <br />
	        38 &para; &ldquo;If a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, specifically white bright spots, <br />
	        39 then the priest shall look; and indeed if the bright spots on the skin of the body are dull white, it is a white spot that grows on the skin. He is clean. <br />
	        40 &para; &ldquo;As for the man whose hair has fallen from his head, he is bald, but he is clean. <br />
	        41 He whose hair has fallen from his forehead, he is bald on the forehead, but he is clean. <br />
	        42 And if there is on the bald head or bald forehead a reddish-white sore, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead. <br />
	        43 Then the priest shall examine it; and indeed if the swelling of the sore is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy on the skin of the body, <br />
	        44 he is a leprous man. He is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his sore is on his head. <br />
	        45 &para; &ldquo;Now the leper on whom the sore is, his clothes shall be torn and his head bare; and he shall cover his mustache, and cry, &lsquo;Unclean! Unclean!&rsquo; <br />
	        46 He shall be unclean. All the days he has the sore he shall be unclean. He is unclean, and he shall dwell alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp. <br />

	<p>On top of everything else the priests had to do, they also served as health inspectors. This chapter deals with <b>the dreaded disease of leprosy.</b> Yes, that's right; <b>the priests were responsible for protecting the Israelites from the contagious spreading of leprosy.</b> In this chapter, directions are given on how the priest is to do just that. These detailed descriptions of oozing skin disorders might just take away your appetite. By the way, our word &quot;leprosy&quot; comes from a Greek word &quot;lepra&quot; which means a scaliness. <b>The descriptions in Leviticus 13 may include more contagious skin ailments than just our modern formal definition for leprosy, but &quot;leprosy&quot; is the most descriptive word we have in English for the assortment of skin maladies being described in this passage.</b> Really, any skin abnormality was tested by the priest, and those with perceived contagious skin diseases were quarantined.<b> </b>We have the description of the disease, as well as the regulations connected with it, in Leviticus 13, continuing on into <a title="Leviticus 14 Summary" href="3-5.html#Top" target="_blank">Leviticus 14 (see notes)</a>. We see the regulations even applied to Miriam (Moses' sister) in <a title="Numbers 12 Summary" href="3-20.html#Moses" target="_blank">Numbers 12:10-15 (see notes)</a>.</p>
		<p><b>There were reckoned six different circumstances under which it might develop itself:</b></p>
		<ol>
          <li>without any apparent cause (verses 2-8)
          <li>its reappearance (verses 9-17)
          <li>from an inflammation (verses 18-28)
          <li>on the head or chin (verses 29-37)
          <li>in white polished spots (verses 38-39)
          <li>at the back or in the front of the head (verses 40-44)
    </ol>
		<p>Lepers were required to live outside the camp or city (<a title="Numbers 5 Summary" href="3-16.html#Unclean" target="_blank">Numbers 5:1-4, see notes</a>; <a title="Numbers 12 Summary" href="3-20.html#Moses" target="_blank">Numbers 12:10-15, see notes</a>). This disease was regarded as an awful punishment from the Lord (Naaman in <a title="II Kings 5 Summary" href="9-3.html#Medicine" target="_blank">II Kings 5:7, see notes</a> and King Uzziah <a title="II Chronicles 26 Summary" href="9-9.html#Uzziah" target="_blank">II Chronicles 26:20, see notes</a>). I'm certain that Miriam (<a title="Numbers 12 Summary" href="3-20.html#Moses" target="_blank">Numbers 12:10-15, see notes</a>) would agree with that assessment after she had expressed criticism of her brother, Moses. As banished from the congregation of Israel for the period of infection, there was a code of conduct to which the leper must adhere. According to verses 45-46, whenever the leper saw someone approaching, the leper must warn that person by crying, &quot;Unclean, unclean!&quot;</p>
		<p><strong><font size="4">What's to be done about the leper's clothing? (Leviticus 13:47-59)</font></strong></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">47 &para; &ldquo;Also, if a garment has a leprous plague in it, whether it is a woolen garment or a linen garment, <br />
48 whether it is in the warp or woof of linen or wool, whether in leather or in anything made of leather, <br />
49 and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather, it is a leprous plague and shall be shown to the priest. <br />
50 The priest shall examine the plague and isolate that which has the plague seven days. <br />
51 And he shall examine the plague on the seventh day. If the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, in the leather or in anything made of leather, the plague is an active leprosy. It is unclean. <br />
52 He shall therefore burn that garment in which is the plague, whether warp or woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of leather, for it is an active leprosy; the garment shall be burned in the fire. <br />
53 &para; &ldquo;But if the priest examines it, and indeed the plague has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather, <br />
54 then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the plague; and he shall isolate it another seven days. <br />
55 Then the priest shall examine the plague after it has been washed; and indeed if the plague has not changed its color, though the plague has not spread, it is unclean, and you shall burn it in the fire; it continues eating away, whether the damage is outside or inside. <br />
56 If the priest examines it, and indeed the plague has faded after washing it, then he shall tear it out of the garment, whether out of the warp or out of the woof, or out of the leather. <br />
57 But if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather, it is a spreading plague; you shall burn with fire that in which is the plague. <br />
58 And if you wash the garment, either warp or woof, or whatever is made of leather, if the plague has disappeared from it, then it shall be washed a second time, and shall be clean. <br />
59 &para; &ldquo;This is the law of the leprous plague in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or woof, or in anything made of leather, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.&rdquo; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
<p>Verses 47-59 deal with infected garments. Of course they were unclean also, and had to be dealt with according to these specific instructions. Having read this chapter, let's reconsider the implications of <a title="Isaiah 64 Summary" href="10-11.html#Continuation" target="_blank">Isaiah 64:6 (see notes)</a>, &quot;But we are all like an unclean thing, 	And all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags...&quot; <b>These &quot;filthy rags&quot; are certainly the rags lepers used to wrap their skin. How's that for filthy!<br>
			</b></p>
	<p>You'll see from these 59 verses that God gave the Hebrews exhaustive, specific instructions on evaluating skin diseases. For the safety of others, isolation was the only remedy until it could be determined that they were disease free.</p>
		<p><b>I find verse 40 amusing,</b> &quot;As for the man whose hair has fallen from his head, he is bald, but he is clean.&quot; But what about the man who has a receding hairline? Verse 41 deals with that, &quot;He whose hair has fallen from his forehead, he is bald on the forehead, but he is clean.&quot; It stops being amusing between verses 42 and 44; that man lost his hair because of leprosy.</p>
	<p><b>By the way, here are some guys who were thankful to be bald. </b>In other words, <b>sometimes you don't have leprosy at all; YOU'RE JUST BALD!</b></p>
