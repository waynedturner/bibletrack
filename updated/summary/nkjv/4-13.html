<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">1 &ldquo;If anyone is found slain, lying in the field in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who killed him, <br />
2 then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure the distance from the slain man to the surrounding cities. <br />
3 And it shall be that the elders of the city nearest to the slain man will take a heifer which has not been worked and which has not pulled with a yoke. <br />
4 The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with flowing water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and they shall break the heifer&rsquo;s neck there in the valley. <br />
5 Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near, for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of the LORD; by their word every controversy and every assault shall be settled.<br />
6 And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. <br />
7 Then they shall answer and say, &ldquo;Our hands have not shed this blood, nor have our eyes seen it.<br />
8 Provide atonement, O LORD, for Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed, and do not lay innocent blood to the charge of Your people Israel.&rsquo; And atonement shall be provided on their behalf for the blood. <br />
9 So you shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you when you do what is right in the sight of the LORD. <br />

</blockquote>
<p>We saw a ritual involving a red heifer back in <a title="Numbers 19 Summary" href="3-24.html#Dead" target="_blank">Numbers 19 (see notes)</a> for the ceremonial cleansing of those who had touched dead bodies. This is a heifer, but not necessarily red. When a slain body is discovered, the elders of the city closest to the location of the body are obligated to bring a specially-qualified heifer to the site and slay it there with the priests by breaking her neck and offering a prayer that the blood of the slain one not be charged to the innocent people of Israel.</p>
<p><a name="Wife"></a><font size="4"><b>What a way to land a wife! (Deuteronomy 21:10-14)<br>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">10 &para; &ldquo;When you go out to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God delivers them into your hand, and you take them captive, <br />
11 and you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and desire her and would take her for your wife, <br />
12 then you shall bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and trim her nails. <br />
13 She shall put off the clothes of her captivity, remain in your house, and mourn her father and her mother a full month; after that you may go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife. <br />
14 And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall set her free, but you certainly shall not sell her for money; you shall not treat her brutally, because you have humbled her. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Here's an interesting law. </font>She's a prisoner of war and now you want to marry her. According to this provision of the law, she may be taken as a wife by the Hebrew captor after she is given a full month to mourn the loss of her family. She shaves her head and pares her nails to indicate a new life as a Hebrew wife. Notice the disposition of this woman if the Hebrew husband tires of her. Before marriage as a slave, she could have been sold. After marriage, however, she must be given her freedom to go wherever she pleases. Of course, she has no family to which she may return.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Son"></a>The disenfranchised elder son catches a break (Deuteronomy 21:15-17)<br>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">15 &para; &ldquo;If a man has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and they have borne him children, both the loved and the unloved, and if the firstborn son is of her who is unloved, <br />
16 then it shall be, on the day he bequeaths his possessions to his sons, that he must not bestow firstborn status on the son of the loved wife in preference to the son of the unloved, the true firstborn. <br />
17 But he shall acknowledge the son of the unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacob did show a partiality toward the firstborn son of Rachel (Joseph) who was actually the eleventh of twelve sons born to Jacob. This law literally protects the rights of the firstborn no matter how much you hated his mom. Ironically, had Abraham been subject to this law, he could not have blessed Isaac over Ishmael with the rights of the firstborn. Here we see a definition of firstborn rights as a &quot;double portion of all that he has.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Yes, parents can get some respect around here! (Deuteronomy 21:18-21)<br>

19 then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, to the gate of his city. <br />
20 And they shall say to the elders of his city, &ldquo;This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.&rsquo; <br />
21 Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones; so you shall put away the evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear and fear. <br />
  </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mom, couldn't I just go to my room without supper?&quot; His mom replies, &quot;Son, where you're going, you won't be needin' a supper.&quot; Yes...we're talking about the stoning to death of one's rebellious son. What age son are we talkin' here, do you suppose? Well, he'd have to be under age twenty; that's the age of manhood in Israel. How fed up with your son must you be to take these drastic measures? I'm just guessing that this punishment encouraged model behavior - just the threat ought to do it.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the mandate for further investigation or other witnesses seen in <a href="4-9.html#Freedom" title="Deuteronomy 13 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 13:14 (see notes)</a> and <a href="4-12.html#Serving" title="Deuteronomy 17 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 17:4 (see notes)</a> is not required in this instance. The word of the parents is all that is required.</p>
<p><a name="Paul"></a><b><font size="4">Paul made reference to this verse (Deuteronomy 21:22-23)<br>

<p><a title="Galatians 3 Summary" href="9-26.html#Curse" target="_blank">Galatians 3:13 (see notes)</a> says, &quot;Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, &ldquo;Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree&rdquo;).&quot; Here's the law in verses 22-23 to which Paul is making reference. Jesus literally became accursed by God as he was upon the cross redeeming the world. The hanging of a body on a tree was most often done, not as the means of death, but rather as a form of public humiliation after death. In the example given here, we know that the means of death for adultery is stoning. The Philistines did similarly with with Saul's body by hanging him on a wall after his death (<a title="I Samuel 31 Summary" href="5-26.html#Saul" target="_blank">I Samuel 31:1-13, see notes</a>). Also, you may recall that the heads of the Hebrew idol worshippers were similarly placed on display before Israel in <a title="Numbers 25 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=1&mo=3&dy=26#Women" target="_blank">Numbers 25:1-18 (see notes)</a>.</p>

<p>I still find it interesting that many Christians want to enforce on others the Mosaic laws they like and disregard the rest. Here are a group of laws that are obviously culturally motivated dealing with lost property, transvestitism, treatment of birds' nests, building codes, and forbidden pairings. For people who maintain that Believers today are responsible for keeping all of the Old Testament laws, they just haven't spent much time reading the Old Testament.</p>
<p><b>Laws found here govern the following:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lending assistance to a fellow Hebrew with regard to his cattle (verses 1-4)			<li>No cross dressing (verse 5)<br>
				Apparently to combat a form of sexual deviation in that day
			
			<li>Regarding a bird's nest (verses 6-7)
			  <br>
		  Take the young or the eggs; let the mama bird go free.<li>Installation of safety rails upon one's house (verse 8)
			<li>No sowing an assortment of seeds in one's vineyard (verse 9)
<br>The reason is not specified, although stated again in <a title="Leviticus 19 Summary" href="3-8.html#Laws" target="_blank">Leviticus 19:19 (see notes)</a>.

		  <p><font size="2">13 &para; &ldquo;If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and detests her, <br />
14 and charges her with shameful conduct, and brings a bad name on her, and says, &ldquo;I took this woman, and when I came to her I found she was not a virgin,&rsquo; <br />

	<p>Israel observed the practice of a legally binding period of betrothal; some period of time later (apparently, typically a year or so) the marriage would follow. This betrothal does not compare very well to our modern practice of a marriage engagement or wedding ceremony. The betrothal was a legally-binding agreement between the father and groom. This usually took place a year or more before marriage. From the time of betrothal, the woman was regarded by everyone as the lawful wife of the man to whom she was betrothed (<a href="4-16.html#Disobey" title="Deuteronomy 28 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 28:30 - see notes</a>; <a href="5-6.html#Gambles" title="Judges 14 Summary" target="_blank">Judges 14:2, 8 - see notes</a>; <a href="1-5.html#Joseph" title="Matthew 1 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 1:18-21 - see notes</a>).The marriage itself consisted basically of the consummation of the relationship. Here's the unusual part. Immediately after the first night for the newlyweds, the parents of the bride would strip the bed and hold in storage the bed sheet for future reference. If the new husband ever called into question the virginity of the bride prior to that night, the stained bed sheet served as evidence before the elders of the city. A false accusation by the husband resulted in a stiff fine, and he relinquished his right to ever divorce her. However, if her virginity previous to her wedding night could not be proved, she was stoned to death.</p>
	<p>Verses 22-30 give us a view of the emphasis placed upon a Hebrew woman's virginity as well as the standing of their women in that society. Her virginity is treated more as the property of her father or husband rather than her own. You will notice in verses 23 and 24 that a man betrothed to a woman is called her husband.</p>
		<p>We then see some special conditions listed with regard to whom gets stoned in the case of adultery in verses 21-30. You will notice that stoning was the associated punishment for adultery in these cases when the woman was the wife or betrothed of another, but not otherwise. If the woman was not committed to another man, the penalty was not death unless she entered a marriage under the pretense of being a virgin and it was discovered not to be so.</p>
		<p>The prohibition of verse 30 is most likely a reference, not to one's own mother, but rather to another of one's father's wives. You will recall that Reuben took advantage of Jacob's wife, Bilhah, in <a title="Genesis 35 Summary" href="2-1.html#Die" target="_blank">Genesis 35:22 (see notes)</a> for which he was told &quot;you shall not excel&quot; in <a title="Genesis 49 Summary" href="2-8.html#Time" target="_blank">Genesis 49:3-4 (see notes)</a> at Jacob's death.</p>

	<p><font size="3">A phrase is used three times in the first three verses - &quot;shall not enter into the assembly of the LORD.&quot; That exact terminology is restricted in the Old Testament to these three verses. We do not know exactly what is meant by this phrase. Most do not feel that it is a reference to dwelling among the Israelites, although some have suggested that it means precisely that. Most agree that this phrase does, indeed, restrict one's participation in Israel's environment in matters such as serving in the military and religious activities.</font></p>
	<p>It's impossible to know for certain, but verse 1 probably speaks of INTENTIONAL actions emulating the self-abusive customs of the heathen around them. Illegitimate children referenced in verse 2 would have probably been those who were born (not necessarily conceived) without both a father and mother. The &quot;tenth-generations&quot; rule was probably used to emphasize that God detests this practice to the point that you will NEVER have an esteemed place with Israel. This wording could mean that they were permitted to live among the Israelites, but as second-class residents not permitted to partake in some of the congregational activities.</p>

	<p>They should've been more helpful like the Edomites and Egyptians. We saw that Canaanites weren't welcome to live among the Hebrews, but those outside Canaan were. However, here's an exception - men from among the Ammonites and Moabites as seen in verse 3, &quot;An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter the assembly of the LORD; even to the tenth generation none of his descendants shall enter the assembly of the LORD forever.&quot; It was because of that Balaam incident back in <a title="Numbers 22 Summary" href="3-25.html#Balaam" target="_blank">Numbers 22-25 (see notes)</a>. This law, however, did not forbid an Israelite man from taking a wife from among them. As a matter of fact, the Hebrew verb translated &quot;shall not enter&quot; (<a href="#Welcome">see note on phrase above</a>) in verse 3 is masculine in gender suggesting that males only are intended to be understood here. One's heritage in Israel was determined by one's father, not one's mother. Remember Ruth? She was a Moabite from whom King David was a descendant. <a title="Ruth Summary" href="5-10.html" target="_blank">See the notes on the Book of Ruth for more details.</a></p>
	<p>Incidentally, the Jews understood the &quot;tenth generation&quot; reference in verse 3 to be the equivalent of &quot;never.&quot; That fact is seen in <a title="Nehemiah 13 Summary" href="12-29.html#Reforms" target="_blank">Nehemiah 13:1 (see notes)</a> where this restriction was once again enforced based upon this very verse.</p>
		<p>The Edomites and Egyptians get a pass in verse 7. However, that was not always to be the case. Later, the Edomites would get considerable negative attention from the prophets. For an overview of Israel's struggle with the Edomites over centuries, <a title="Numbers 20 Summary" href="3-24.html#Esau" target="_blank">see the notes on Numbers 20:14-21</a>. One more thing, while the Egyptians are not listed as forbidden marriages here, the returning exiles in <a href="12-24.html#No" title="Ezra 9 Summary" target="_blank">Ezra 9 (see notes)</a> determined that Egyptian marriages were forbidden as well.</p>

We do know that, in addition to slaves captured in battle, debt slavery and voluntary slavery existed in Israel and was protected by law, so it seems unlikely that this law applies to those two categories of slaves. We simply aren't given any detail beyond these two verses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">17 &para; &ldquo;There shall be no ritual harlot of the daughters of Israel, or a perverted one of the sons of Israel. <br />
18 You shall not bring the wages of a harlot or the price of a dog to the house of the LORD your God for any vowed offering, for both of these are an abomination to the LORD your God. <br />

<p>Whoredom was not permitted among the daughters of Israel. The &quot;price of a dog&quot; speaks to money acquired by dishonorable means - probably referring to the male prostitute. Sodomy was absolutely forbidden in Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="2">19 &para; &ldquo;You shall not charge interest to your brother&mdash;interest on money or food or anything that is lent out at interest. <br />
20 To a foreigner you may charge interest, but to your brother you shall not charge interest, that the LORD your God may bless you in all to which you set your hand in the land which you are entering to possess. <br />
21 &para; &ldquo;When you make a vow to the LORD your God, you shall not delay to pay it; for the LORD your God will surely require it of you, and it would be sin to you. <br />
22 But if you abstain from vowing, it shall not be sin to you. <br />
23 That which has gone from your lips you shall keep and perform, for you voluntarily vowed to the LORD your God what you have promised with your mouth. <br />
24 &para; &ldquo;When you come into your neighbor&rsquo;s vineyard, you may eat your fill of grapes at your pleasure, but you shall not put any in your container. <br />
25 When you come into your neighbor&rsquo;s standing grain, you may pluck the heads with your hand, but you shall not use a sickle on your neighbor&rsquo;s standing grain. </font> </p>

<p>Hebrew bankers? NO! It's tough to make an income without interest. However, one could lend to non-Hebrews with interest. And another law: Don't promise it (make a vow) if you can't keep it in verses 21-23. We find these vows dealt with in <a title="Leviticus 27 Summary" href="3-12.html#Vows" target="_blank">Leviticus 27 (see notes)</a> and <a title="Numbers 30 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=03&dy=29#Vows" target="_blank">Numbers 30 (see notes)</a>.</p>
<p>And how about those poor people? Eat what you want out of the vineyard, but don't you dare carry any of it away in anything but your stomach! And regarding the grain field, only take what you can pluck by hand.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, the Pharisees accused the disciples of Jesus of breaking the law when they gathered grain on the Sabbath day for personal consumption (<a title="Matthew 12:1-8; Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5 Summary" href="1-29.html#Corn" target="_blank">Matthew 12:1-8; Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5, see notes</a>). They accused them of reaping grain on the Sabbath. We see from this passage of scripture that doing so in the field itself was simply feeding oneself, not reaping.</p>
