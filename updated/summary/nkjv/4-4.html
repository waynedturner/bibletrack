    <p><font size="4"><b>An introduction to Deuteronomy<br>
				</b></font><font size="3">The wandering is over, and 40 years have passed since the Hebrews left Egypt. Here they sit on the east side of the Jordan River ready to go into Canaan to possess it. But first, let's get a second giving of the Law of Moses. That's what &quot;Deuteronomy&quot; means; it's not a Semitic word at all, but rather a compound Greek word - &quot;Deutero&quot; (second) and &quot;nomy&quot; (law), a name adopted for it as a result of the Old Testament translation into the Greek Septuagint. Hang on for a repeat of the giving of the Law to the Hebrews before they go possess their new land. Interestingly, the Hebrew Bible calls this book &quot;Devarim,&quot; derived from the opening phrase in the Hebrew text of verse 1:1, &quot;These [are or be] the <b>words</b>...&quot; Therefore, the Hebrew Bible just calls this fifth book of the bible &quot;Words.&quot; Deuteronomy was written by Moses, as was Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.</font> Since Joshua was Moses' right-hand man, he undoubtedly had a hand in helping Moses with these writings. He certainly must have been the one who completed Moses' work after his death.</p>
<p>While the very name assigned to this book indicates a second giving of the Law of Moses, in actuality, there are some variations to the Law of Moses in the Book of Deuteronomy. Now that they are prepared to enter into Canaan, some lifestyle issues will be little different now that they will no longer be touring the Sinai Peninsula. We'll point out some of those variations along the way.</p>
<p><a name="Command"></a><font size="4"><b>The command to enter Canaan (Deuteronomy 1:1-8)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 &para; These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite Suph, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. <br />
2 It is eleven days&rsquo; journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea. <br />
3 Now it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him as commandments to them, <br />
4 after he had killed Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei. <br />
5 &para; On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying, <br />
6 &ldquo;The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: &lsquo;You have dwelt long enough at this mountain. <br />
7 Turn and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring places in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates. <br />
8 See, I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers&mdash;to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&mdash;to give to them and their descendants after them.&rsquo; <br />

	<p>Hey! Haven't we been in this situation before? This time they're actually going to do what God says without murmuring. But before going into Canaan, the Hebrews have some history to go over and some laws to reiterate. How long since the Hebrews left Egypt? There's your answer in verse 3, &quot;...in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month...&quot; </p>

		<p><strong>Here's the question: How long should it have taken to travel from Mount Sinai (aka Mount Horeb) where they camped after leaving Egypt to Kadesh Barnea? Answer: 11 days (verse 2).</strong> Now, keep in mind: That's not the travel time from Egypt to Canaan; that's the travel time from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea. Kadesh Barnea was located in the southern part of Judah, and Mount Horeb was on the Sinai Peninsula just over from Midian. It's the place where Moses kept his Midianite father-in-law's cattle previous to the Exodus. The 15+ months at Mount Horeb was necessary to get Israel organized as a nation before they embarked upon their quest to possess Canaan.</p>
		<p>Now, hang on while Moses gives us a recap of the highlights of their journey from Egypt. He begins to recap the battles that got them there (positioned on the east side of the Jordan River) in verse 4 when he mentions King Sihon and King Og (<a title="Numbers 21 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=03&dy=25#Sihon" target="_blank">Numbers 21, see notes</a>). We see in verses 7-8 the declaration that it is time to cross the Jordan River and &quot;go in and possess the land.&quot; You will notice a boundary reference to Lebanon and the Euphrates River in verse 7. <a title="Israel's Promised Land Map" href="4-9.html#Map" target="_blank">To see a map of the promised land, click here.</a></p>
	<p>We see in verse 8 a reference to the Abrahamic Covenant, &quot;...go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers&mdash;to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&mdash;to give to them and their descendants after them.&quot; <a title="The Abrahamic Covenant" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Abrahamic_Covenant.html" target="_blank">The provisions of that covenant can be seen by clicking here to read, &quot;The Abrahamic Covenant.&quot;</a></p>

11 May the LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times more numerous than you are, and bless you as He has promised you! <br />

14 And you answered me and said, &ldquo;The thing which you have told us to do is good.&rsquo; <br />

    <p>Here's a sad time in Israel's history. We first saw the incident in <a title="Numbers 13 Summary" href="3-20.html#Grasshopper" target="_blank">Numbers 13 (see notes)</a> upon the return of the spies. The subsequent rebellion in <a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="3-21.html#People" target="_blank">Numbers 14 (see notes)</a> sealed their fate for the next 38+ years. They sent the spies into Canaan, but upon their return with land specimens and stories of their forty days away from home, the people were afraid to go into Canaan. <b>What's worse, they murmured and threatened the lives of Moses, Aaron, Joshua and Caleb on that occasion.</b> One new item that we see in this passage of scripture that we did not get from Numbers is the fact that <b>it was the peoples' idea to send the spies into Canaan</b> rather than just go on in and possess it (verse 22). But Moses points out in verse 26, &quot;Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.&quot; That gives us an idea of God's longsuffering; he tolerated their negotiations with Moses, but did not tolerate their ultimate refusal to go into Canaan at that time.</p>
    <p><font size="4"><b><a name="Penalty"></a>Moses recap: The penalty for their rebellion (Deuteronomy 1:34-46)</b></font><br>

36 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his children I am giving the land on which he walked, because he wholly followed the LORD.&rsquo; <br />
37 The LORD was also angry with me for your sakes, saying, &ldquo;Even you shall not go in there. <br />
38 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. <br />
39 &para; &ldquo;Moreover your little ones and your children, who you say will be victims, who today have no knowledge of good and evil, they shall go in there; to them I will give it, and they shall possess it. <br />

    <p>This story is being told by Moses to the children of those rebels back in <a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="3-21.html#God" target="_blank">Numbers 14:20-45 (see notes)</a>. It's important that history does not repeat itself. <b>Some additional insight is given in this passage indicating that the penalty for their rebellion did not extend to the premature deaths of the women in Israel - just &quot;men of war.&quot; Furthermore, we deduct that the Levites were exempt as well.</b> See the discussion in the information frame on the right side of this page. Moses points out in verse 39 why the children of these rebels were not held responsible, &quot;Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and <b>your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil</b>, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.&quot; Moses recalls in verses 41-46 that, in their remorse regarding their rebellion against Moses, they decided to try to go into Canaan without God's leading hand (<a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="3-21.html#God" target="_blank">Numbers 14:39-45 - see notes</a>) - FAILED!

2 &para; &ldquo;And the LORD spoke to me, saying: <br />
3 &ldquo;You have skirted this mountain long enough; turn northward. <br />
4 And command the people, saying, &ldquo;You are about to pass through the territory of your brethren, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore watch yourselves carefully. <br />
5 Do not meddle with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as one footstep, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. <br />

11 They were also regarded as giants, like the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim. <br />

15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they were consumed. <br />

<p><font size="3">Verse 1 recaps <a title="Numbers 14 Summary" href="3-21.html#God" target="_blank">Numbers 14:25 (see notes)</a> when God led them back into the wilderness. Beginning with verse 2 Moses' history lesson takes up with contemporary history.</font><font size="4"><b> </b></font><font size="3">He gives a recap of what happened as they emerged from their 38 years of journeying in the wilderness. This recent history we saw as we read through Numbers. Highlights in this passage include God's decree that Israel not attack the Edomites (verses 1-8). These are Esau's descendants, but history reveals to us that the Edomites, for the centuries following, would be a thorn in Israel's side (<a title="Numbers 20 Summary" href="3-24.html#Esau" target="_blank">see notes on Numbers 20:14-21 regarding the Edomites</a>). Moses then recounts how the Lord had told them to try to work with the Moabites, Lot's descendants, and the Ammonites (also Lot's descendants). However, Moses goes into some detail to show us that the Moabites and Ammonites had been somewhat displaced by the Amorites. Moses is not instructed to avoid the Amorites - they're not related. That takes us up to Israel's engagement with them, specifically, King Sihon in verse 26.</font></p>

27 &ldquo;Let me pass through your land; I will keep strictly to the road, and I will turn neither to the right nor to the left. <br />
28 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot, <br />
29 just as the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan to the land which the LORD our God is giving us.&rsquo; <br />
30 &para; &ldquo;But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into your hand, as it is this day. <br />
31 &para; &ldquo;And the LORD said to me, &lsquo;See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to possess it, that you may inherit his land.&rsquo; <br />
32 Then Sihon and all his people came out against us to fight at Jahaz. <br />
33 And the LORD our God delivered him over to us; so we defeated him, his sons, and all his people. <br />
34 We took all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed the men, women, and little ones of every city; we left none remaining. <br />
35 We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we took. <br />
36 From Aroer, which is on the bank of the River Arnon, and from the city that is in the ravine, as far as Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us; the LORD our God delivered all to us. <br />
37 Only you did not go near the land of the people of Ammon&mdash;anywhere along the River Jabbok, or to the cities of the mountains, or wherever the LORD our God had forbidden us. </font> </p>

<p>And then there's King Sihon in <a title="Numbers 21 Summary" href="3-25.html#Sihon" target="_blank">Numbers 21:21-32 (see notes)</a>. When asked for free passage, this Amorite King should have said to Israel, &quot;My pleasure!&quot; <b>His mistake was fatal.</b> Moses recalls the aftermath and haul of the spoils after this great defeat of King Sihon.</p>
