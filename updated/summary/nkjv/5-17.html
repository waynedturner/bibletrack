<p><strong>In this passage, we see the following in Jesus&#39; ministry:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Jesus is on Mount Olivet overlooking Jerusalem.</li>
	<li>These events take place during the week preceding his crucifixion.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>What you need to know about these passages</b></font><br />
<font size="3">All three of these are records of Jesus&#39; final teaching overlooking the Temple prior to his crucifixion. </font><font color="black">Because Jesus gives these comments while upon the Mount of Olives</font><font size="3">, t</font><font size="3">his teaching session is commonly referred to as <b><strong>&quot;The Olivet Discourse.&quot;</strong></b> In this session, <b>Jesus answers questions posed to him by his disciples on issues of prophecy.</b> The prophetic events outlined by Jesus in these chapters <b>are given in chronological order.</b> This fact is very important in order to recognize the proper context for these events. <b>Since, in my mind, a pre-tribulation rapture of the church is the most defensible prophetic view of the rapture and second coming, these comments will explain these passages in that context.</b></font></p>


<p><font size="3">I will say that good people disagree on the timing of the rapture of the church with respect to when, exactly, Believers will disappear from this earth in relation to this seven-year tribulation period. Every serious student of prophecy is typically able to make a strong case (at least in his own mind) as to why he holds his particular view. Volumes have been written in defense of each of these positions. Having studied those positions over the years,<b> I remain convinced that the position espousing that Jesus will receive Believers into Heaven at the beginning of the seven-year period </b>(<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=20#Rapture" target="_blank" title="I Thessalonians 4 Summary">I Thessalonians 4:13-18, see notes</a> and <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=10#Mystery" target="_blank" title="I Corinthians 15 Summary">I Corinthians 15:51-53, see notes</a>)<b> and finally return to earth to stay at the end of that period is the most explicable view.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">When one of his disciples comments on the magnificent structure of Herod&#39;s Temple, Jesus comments that these massive stones will be completely razed to the ground at some future date.</font><font size="4"> </font><font size="3"><b>How can one let a comment like that go by without further explanation?</b> Peter, James, John and Andrew then ask Jesus about the time frame for such an event. <b>They expand the question to include all the prophetic milestones about which Jesus had spoken during his ministry </b>when they ask in Matthew 24:3, &quot;Tell us, when will these things be?

<p><font size="3"><b>Historical facts give us a little more context than the disciples had when Jesus spoke these words.</b> In fact, the temple was destroyed in 70 A.D. by the Romans as prophesied by Jesus in these verses. It is for that reason that the world realities explained in this passage down to </font>Matthew 24:15, Mark 13:14 and Luke 21:20 may characterize activities at any time between the time Jesus issued these comments until the beginning of the second half of the tribulation period. That being said, it is certain that these world realities will exist during the first half of the tribulation period.</p>

<p>As stated above, some of these indicators may precede the actual seven-year tribulation, but certainly characterize those first 3 1/2 years. So to be clear, Jesus&#39; characterization of this period is sequential - making <font size="3">Matthew 24:4-14, Mark 13:5-13 and Luke 21:8-19</font> a picture of life during the tribulation leading up to the midpoint of the seven-year period. The exact middle of the tribulation appears in <font size="3">Matthew 24:15, Mark 13:14 and Luke 21:20</font> (<a href="#Antichrist">see below</a>).</p>

<p>Thus, the seven-year tribulation is divided up into two distinct periods in prophetic scripture - the first 3 1/2 years and the last 3 1/2 years. The events prophesied by Jesus to take place in the first half are tumultuous, but are mild by comparison to those which are prophesied for the second half.<b> The beginning of the second half is marked by the man students of prophecy generally refer to as the Antichrist</b> (<a href="#Antichrist">see below</a>)<b> moving into the rebuilt Temple and demanding that he be worshipped as God.</b> Since that event is not marked in these passages until Matthew 24:15, Mark 13:14 and Luke 21:20 (<a href="#Antichrist">see below</a>), it is logical to assume that all of the events prior to these milestone verses take place either in the first half of the tribulation or perhaps some of them even before the rapture of the church altogether. <b>All this passage tells us is that they take place prior to the second half of the tribulation period.</b></p>

<p><b>Here&#39;s what Jesus says will characterize this period, the first half of the seven-year tribulation:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>False christs (messiahs)</li>
	<li>An unusually excessive number of wars</li>
	<li>Unusual occurrences of natural phenomena like famine, pestilence and earthquakes</li>
	<li>Increased persecution of the righteous</li>
	<li>An increase in the number of false prophets</li>
	<li>The preaching of the Kingdom message in the world (i.e. the rule of the Messiah over the earth from the millennium forward)</li>
</ul>

<p>As I indicated, <b>some of these events may take place prior to the rapture of the church, but not necessarily</b>. What these passages tell us for certain is that <b>these will be the conditions that will exist during the first half of the tribulation.</b></p>

<p><b>Matthew 24:13 has been frequently misused by those looking for ammunition in their attempt to prove that one may lose one&#39;s salvation.</b> One&#39;s salvation may not be lost. The notion that it can be lost flies in the face of the whole unconditional-covenant theology clearly outlined in both the Old Testament and New Testament. Salvation is an unconditional covenant that God makes with each Believer at the time when he trusts Jesus Christ as his personal savior. That covenant cannot be broken; from that time forward, God deals with Believers as his children. For more information on this special relationship between God and the Believer, <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Trial_vs_chastisement.html" target="_blank" title="Trial versus Chastisement">see the article entitled &quot;Trial versus Chastisement&quot; by clicking here.</a></p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s explain Matthew 24:13, &quot;But he who endures to the end shall be saved.&quot; First of all, understand that this is a tribulation-period verse - spoken immediately before Jesus explains the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; which we know takes place at the half-way point of the tribulation, seen in Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14 (<a href="#Antichrist">see below</a>). That, in itself, removes it from applicability to spiritual salvation prior to the rapture of Believers. But wait! There&#39;s more. In Mark&#39;s parallel of this passage, he leads into it with verse 13:10, &quot;And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.&quot; Matthew makes that statement in verse 24:14. This is a direct reference to the 144,000 Jewish witnesses who are sealed by God during the tribulation period seen in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=15#144,000" target="_blank" title="Revelation 7 Summary">Revelation 7:1-8 (see notes)</a> and <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=23#Facts" target="_blank" title="Revelation 14 Summary">Revelation 14:1-5 (see notes)</a> for the purpose of evangelizing the world. In Luke&#39;s parallel to this passage in verse 21:18, we see that Jesus makes it clear that he&#39;s talking about the physical salvation (i.e. deliverance from physical death) of these 144,000 Jewish witnesses when he says, &quot;But not a hair of your head shall be lost.&quot; So, you see, this verse has nothing whatsoever to do with spiritual salvation during the present dispensation of grace. To misuse it as such is to do a disservice to scriptural context.</p>

<p>Perhaps the clearest milestone in these passages is the appearance of the &quot;abomination of desolation.&quot; Matthew and Mark are even careful to specify that this event equates to Daniel 9:27, a prophetic passage of scripture that positively identifies the individual commonly referred to as the &quot;Antichrist&quot; (aka <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=23#Beasts" target="_blank" title="Revelation 13 Summary">&quot;Beast&quot; of Revelation 13, see notes</a>). <b>It is in Daniel&#39;s prophecy </b>(<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=12&amp;dy=12#Weeks" target="_blank" title="Daniel 9:24-27 Summary">Daniel 9:24-27, see notes</a>)<b> where we learn that this event marks the mid point of the seven-year tribulation.</b> This Antichrist will inhabit the Most Holy Place of the Temple (&quot;abomination of desolation&quot;) and will pronounce himself to be God. <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=10&amp;dy=24#Tribulation" target="_blank" title="II Thessalonians 2 Summary">II Thessalonians 2 (see notes)</a> gives us a detailed account of his activities in that regard at this time.</p>

<p>Now, notice these verses (Matthew 24:16-20; Mark 14:13-18; Luke 21:21-24) where immediately following the tribulation midpoint of the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; described in the preceding paragraph, the remnant of the righteous in Jerusalem are told to &quot;flee&quot; into the wilderness. Many prophecy teachers feel strongly that the place to which they will flee is a place called &quot;Bozrah&quot; found in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=9&amp;dy=17#Messianic" target="_blank" title="Micah 2 Summary">Micah 2:12 (see notes)</a>. That&#39;s located in ancient Edom (modern-day Jordan), east of the Dead Sea in the mountainous region there. That position has great scriptural merit and should be considered by serious students of prophecy as a likely scenario.</p>

<p><font color="black">Matthew 24:21 declares, &quot;For then there will be great tribulation...&quot; <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=15#144,000" target="_blank" title="Revelation 7 Summary">Revelation 7:14 (see notes)</a> also makes reference to this period (last 3 1/2 years of the tribulation) as &quot;great tribulation.&quot; It is a period of intense, catastrophic world-wide happenings. Notice what Luke tells us about this period in Luke 21:24, &quot;And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.&quot; He points out that <b>Jerusalem during this second half of the tribulation will be overcome with Gentile enemies.</b></font> More is written by Paul concerning this in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=8&amp;dy=21#Fulness" target="_blank" title="Romans 11 Summary">Romans 11:25-26 (see notes)</a>, &quot; For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: &#39;The Deliverer will come out of Zion, And He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.&#39;&quot; Paul is undoubtedly making reference to Jesus&#39; comments here.</p>

<p><font color="black">Based upon the chronology of Matthew, Mark and Luke compared to John&#39;s Revelation, I am confident with the position that the events of <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=0&amp;mo=12&amp;dy=15#Life" target="_blank" title="Revelation 6 Summary">Revelation 6 (see notes)</a> coincide with the first-half events outlined here by Matthew, Mark and Luke. I&#39;m convinced that the second half of the tribulation, which begins with the &quot;abomination of desolation,&quot; is consistent with the events in Revelation that begin with chapter 8; Revelation 7 serves as a non-chronological overview summary</font><font color="black">. <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=12&amp;dy=19" target="_blank" title="Revelation 9-12 Summary">For a better view of this chronology, click here to see the notes on Revelation 9-12.</a> Revelation chapters 8-19 give exhaustive details regarding these second-half cataclysmic events; Jesus just briefly summarizes them here. </font></p>
