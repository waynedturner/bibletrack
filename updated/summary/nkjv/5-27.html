				</b></font><font size="3">In all of these Psalms (120-134) the introduction to each says &quot;A Song of Ascents.&quot; We're not certain what these Hebrew superscriptions mean</font><font size="3">.</font> The Hebrew word for &quot;ascents&quot; means &quot;steps of ascent.&quot; The Mishnah (Jewish collection of writings on Jewish thought and tradition) assigns the collection of fifteen songs with the fifteen steps of the temple, suggesting that the Levites sang these songs of ascents. Perhaps, but it may rather be that the songs were so subtitled because they were sung in the three annual festival processions, as the participants &quot;ascended&quot; to Jerusalem. Those three annual festivals were Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits and Tabernacles (<a title="Exodus 34 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=02&dy=24#Forty" target="_blank">see notes on Exodus 34:10-28</a>).</p>

	    The author of this Psalm is not given. God will preserve Israel. This Psalm emphasizes God's faithfulness in being responsive to Israel. The key to this passage is verse 1, &quot;I will lift up my eyes to the hills&mdash; From whence comes my help?&quot; Whenever Israel looked to God, God was faithful to deliver them; he was always available. </font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Notice verses 3-4; in other documents discovered in Mesopotamia and determined to be written during this same period, a &quot;sleeping god&quot; is a common term and is used to describe one who is unresponsive to the prayers of the person who is calling out for help. You may recall when Elijah was ridiculing Baal in <a title="I Kings 18 Summary" href="8-26.html#Showdown" target="_blank">I Kings 18:27 (see notes)</a> for his lack of abilities he said, &quot;...perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.&quot; Of course, Israel's problem was always that they went after other gods. All of their failures as a nation were as a result of not calling upon the one true God of Israel.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>To whom do you look for provision (Psalm 123)<br>

O You who dwell in the heavens. <br>

As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,<br>
So our eyes look to the LORD our God,<br>
Until He has mercy on us. <br>
3 	Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy on us!<br>
For we are exceedingly filled with contempt. <br>
4 	Our soul is exceedingly filled<br>
With the scorn of those who are at ease,<br>
With the contempt of the proud. </font></p>

  In verse 3, the psalmist states a contrast between the wicked and those who have been deemed righteous by God, &quot;Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy on us! For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.&quot;  Through God's mercy, He has taken away our contempt and made us righteous.</font></p>

  2 	&ldquo;If it had not been the LORD who was on our side,<br>

When their wrath was kindled against us; <br>

The stream would have gone over our soul; <br>
5 	Then the swollen waters<br>
Would have gone over our soul.&rdquo; <br>
6 	Blessed be the LORD,<br>
Who has not given us as prey to their teeth. <br>
7 	Our soul has escaped as a bird from the snare of the fowlers;<br>
The snare is broken, and we have escaped. <br>
8 	Our help is in the name of the LORD,<br>

  Without God on our side, some really bad things could have happened. But God delivered us. Note the analogy given by David in verse 7 of the bird escaping from the snare. David must have felt this way finally after Saul was dead.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good (Psalm 125)<br>

Are like Mount Zion,<br>
Which cannot be moved, but abides forever. <br>
2 	As the mountains surround Jerusalem,<br>
So the LORD surrounds His people<br>
From this time forth and forever. <br>
3 	For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest<br>
On the land allotted to the righteous,<br>
Lest the righteous reach out their hands to iniquity. <br>
4 	Do good, O LORD, to those who are good,<br>
And to those who are upright in their hearts. <br>
5 	As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways,<br>
The LORD shall lead them away<br>
With the workers of iniquity.<br>
Peace be upon Israel! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><a href="#Degrees">For insight regarding the term &quot;A song of Ascents,&quot; click here to see the introduction to these Psalms.</a><br>
  Peace shall be upon Israel. The reference to Mount Zion here identifies Jerusalem, and specifically the place where David authorized the building of Solomon's Temple. Today, &quot;Zionist&quot; is a word used to describe those who sought to reestablish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Modern Zionism is concerned with the support and development of the State of Israel.</font></p>

You shall be happy, and it shall be well with you. <br>
3 	Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine<br>
In the very heart of your house,<br>
Your children like olive plants<br>
All around your table. <br>
4 	Behold, thus shall the man be blessed<br>
Who fears the LORD. <br>
5 	The LORD bless you out of Zion,<br>

  We are not told the author of this Psalm. This whole Psalm elaborates upon verse 1, &quot;Blessed is every one who fears the LORD, Who walks in His ways.&quot; The Hebrew word for &quot;fear&quot; in verse 1 is &quot;yaw-ray&acute;&quot; and sometimes means &quot;moral reverence,&quot; as is the case here. You will notice in this Psalm, y</font>our family will be blessed as well when you serve God.</p>

Yet they have not prevailed against me. <br>
3 	The plowers plowed on my back;<br>
They made their furrows long.&rdquo; <br>
4 	The LORD is righteous;<br>
He has cut in pieces the cords of the wicked. <br>
5 	Let all those who hate Zion<br>
Be put to shame and turned back. <br>
6 	Let them be as the grass on the housetops,<br>
Which withers before it grows up, <br>
7 	With which the reaper does not fill his hand,<br>
Nor he who binds sheaves, his arms. <br>
8 	Neither let those who pass by them say,<br>
&ldquo;The blessing of the LORD be upon you;<br>
We bless you in the name of the LORD!&rdquo; <br>

  While the theme of this Psalm sounds like David, the author is not known. Take care of them, Lord. That's what the Psalmist is saying when we see in verse 5, &quot;Let all those who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned back.&quot; The author's use of the word &quot;Zion&quot; here embodies a lifestyle of dependence upon the God of Israel. He looks to God for his protection from his enemies. </p>
<p>Note the reference in verse 6 to &quot;grass on the housetops.&quot; That's a funny place to find grass. However, with regard to the construction of homes during that period, the uppermost roof was constructed of beams laid across the walls intertwined with reeds and grasses. The whole roof would then be plastered with mud to fill in the gaps and make them relatively water resistant. Seeds in the grass or mud might briefly sprout but would quickly die for lack of roots.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>I have cried to You, O LORD (Psalm 130)<br>

2 	Lord, hear my voice!<br>
Let Your ears be attentive<br>
To the voice of my supplications. <br>
3 	If You, LORD, should mark iniquities,<br>
O Lord, who could stand? <br>
4 	But there is forgiveness with You,<br>
That You may be feared. <br>
5 	I wait for the LORD, my soul waits,<br>
And in His word I do hope. <br>
6 	My soul waits for the Lord<br>
More than those who watch for the morning&mdash;<br>
Yes, more than those who watch for the morning. <br>
7 	O Israel, hope in the LORD;<br>
For with the LORD there is mercy,<br>
And with Him is abundant redemption. <br>
8 	And He shall redeem Israel<br>
From all his iniquities.</font></p>
