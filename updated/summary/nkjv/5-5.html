	    <p>We find three different perspectives here from the Gospel writers on the same series of incidents. Matthew is the briefest of the three accounts. He gives a brief overview of the fig tree incident including the actions of both days involved into one short account which he summarizes in verses 18-22 (<a href="#Fig">see below</a>). The sequence of events regarding the fig tree obviously appeals to Mark, so he gives the details of what exactly happened on the preceding day (the actual cursing of the tree in verses 12-14) leading up to the observation of the cursing in verses 20-26 (<a href="#Fig">see below</a>). Luke, on the other hand, reports Jesus' lament and prophecy over Jerusalem before entering into the Temple. Based upon the accounts of Mark and Luke, two incidents took place just prior to the entry into the Temple, the cursing of the fig tree and the prophecy over Jerusalem concerning its destruction. Are these actions by Jesus related, or are they to be taken as two unrelated activities on the same day prior to entering the Temple. We'll look at that question further in the next section (<a href="#Fig">see below</a>).		</p>
    <p><b>Incidentally, let's take a closer look at Mark 11:13-14 to clear up a point of confusion:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>13 And seeing from afar a fig tree having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. <br />
14 In response Jesus said to it, &ldquo;Let no one eat fruit from you ever again.&rdquo;  And His disciples heard it.<br />
				</p>
		  </blockquote>
	</blockquote>
		<p>The phrase, &quot;for it was not the season for figs&quot; has caused a great deal of anguish among Bible scholars. Here's the simple reality: Figs were on the tree in March, and some were ripe enough to eat. However, it was not yet time for the spring harvest of figs. You will notice the presence of figs on this Jerusalem tree in the photo to the right of this page taken in March, 2004. <a title="Fig Trees in Israel" href="http://www.bibletrack.com/notes/resource/misc/Figs.html" target="_blank">You may view photos of the entire fig-bearing cycle of this fig tree found in Jerusalem by clicking here.</a></p>
	<p>Meanwhile, back at the Temple it's deja vu all over again. Remember back in <a title="John 2 Summary" href="1-17.html#Temple" target="_blank">John 2:12-25 (see notes)</a> when Jesus tackled the corruption in the Temple. <b>This time is a little different. He has just ridden into Jerusalem and has been identified by the people as the Messiah.</b> The Jewish leaders are there, but powerless to do anything. Look at verse Matthew 21:15, &quot;But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David!&rdquo; they were indignant.&quot; Only Matthew reports that spontaneous outburst by the children and the healings in verse 14 that prompted it. <b>This was just more than the Temple big wigs could stand.</b> They call upon Jesus to rebuke these children, but Jesus simply quotes <a href="5-30.html#Earth" title="Psalm 8 Summary" target="_blank">Psalm 8:2 (see notes)</a> when he says, &quot;Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise?&quot; With these words, <b>Jesus has just acknowledged to these Jewish leaders that he is, indeed, the promised Messiah. </b>What had started out as a typical pre-passover business day at the temple for these Jewish leaders ends up with an intolerable twist. Not only does Jesus disrupt the disgraceful selling of sacrifices by overturning their tables, but he is subsequently perceived by the &quot;little people&quot; there to have complete authority as the Messiah to have done so.</p>
	<p>All three accounts record the words of Jesus as he quoted <a title="Isaiah 56 Summary" href="10-9.html#Hope" target="_blank">Isaiah 56:7 (see notes)</a> in Matthew 21:13, Mark 11:17 and Luke 19:46 where Isaiah prophesied, &quot;Even them I will bring to My holy mountain, 	And make them joyful in My house of prayer. 	Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices 	Will be accepted on My altar; 	For My house shall be called a house of prayer <strong>for all nations.</strong>&quot; That prophecy of Isaiah is particularly interesting in that <a title="Isaiah 55-56 Summary" href="10-9.html#Gentiles" target="_blank">Isaiah 55 and the first 8 verses of Isaiah 56 (see notes)</a> deal with the fact that the temple will become the center of worship for Gentiles as well as Jews in the coming Kingdom age. Only Mark adds this international flavor to temple worship in his quote of Isaiah.</p>
	<p>Luke begins his account with Jesus weeping as he overlooks Jerusalem, but then includes a prophecy regarding Jerusalem's future in verses 43-44. There we see Jesus detailing what would befall Jerusalem in 70 A.D. when the Romans, under General Titus, would besiege and destroy the city. </p>
	<p>One more point should be observed regarding this Temple incident. This was no get-in-fast-and-get-out-fast action on Jesus' part. You will notice from Mark's account in verse 16 that Jesus apparently stayed around long enough to enforce some reverence for the Temple that day. Mark also points out in verse 19 that Jesus stayed in the city until &quot;evening had come&quot; after teaching  the people. Obviously, this was Jesus' time to fulfill prophecy.</p>

		<p>Only Matthew and Mark deal with the fig-tree incident - Matthew more briefly than Mark. As a matter of fact, Mark is very detailed in pointing out that the actual cursing took place prior to entering the Temple (Mark 11:14, <a href="#Hey">see above</a>); the observation of the results took place the next day. <b>Some deduct more implications from this incident than others.</b> Is this a simple demonstration of the power of faith or something more? With an observance only of the accounts by Matthew and Mark, one might be led to understand that this incident is just a lesson on faith. Certainly one of the strongest declarations on the power of prayer is found in Matthew 21:22, &quot;And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.&quot; As certainly as Jesus had caused the fig tree to wither, so shall our prayer life be empowered when faith is present.</p>
	<p><b>Many teachers today have linked the fig tree here to Israel.</b> Jesus causes the fig tree to wither because it did not bear figs. <b>Likewise, many teach, that Jesus passes the same judgment on Israel because of their rejection of his Messiahship.</b> To others, that may seem to be a significant overreaction to the incident. However, it should be pointed out that while Matthew and Mark are reporting the withering of the fig tree, Luke is reporting, within the same time frame, the Jesus citation concerning the blindness and rejection of the Messiah in Luke 19:42 (<a href="#Hey">see above</a>) as he prophesies over Jerusalem. Within this prophecy he pronounces the total destruction of the Temple, which took place later, in 70 A.D. <b>While none of the Gospel writers make the linkage here, it is undeniable that the cursing of the fig tree took place at nearly the same time as the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem; perhaps they even took place within the same discourse. Well...maybe the fig tree incident is more than just a lesson on faith;</b> you make the call. Incidentally, you see more when you read all the eyewitness accounts simultaneously, don't you?</p>
	<p>Let's add one more piece of evidence to the fig tree incident here. Jesus had given a temporary reprieve to a fig tree in his parable of <a title="Luke 13 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=04&dy=07#Israel" target="_blank">Luke 13:6-9 (see notes)</a>. In that parable Jesus seems to be comparing his appeal to Jerusalem with the nurturing of a fig tree. In that parable, if the fig tree did not bear fruit within the year, it was to be destroyed. Jesus specifically references &quot;three years&quot; in that parable, presumably the same length of time Jesus had been reaching out to Jerusalem. There are strong indications that the fig tree in Luke 13 is a metaphor for Jerusalem/Israel and that the &quot;dresser&quot; is Jesus. That consideration seems to add strength to the notion that the cursing of the fig tree here just prior to the crucifixion has linkage and significance; the year of <a title="Luke 13 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=04&dy=07#Israel" target="_blank">Luke 13:8 (see notes)</a> is up. For more information regarding the expectations that this fig tree should have figs in March, <a href="#Hey">see above</a>.</p>

		<p>As Jesus enters into the Temple to teach, a particularly troubled bunch of Jewish leaders approach him asking by what authority he is doing &quot;these things.&quot; <b>This Jesus visit has been tough on them.</b> Jesus rode into Jerusalem as royalty and was received that way. Then he reclaimed the integrity of the Temple; now he's teaching there. A day or two have passed, and Jesus is still there teaching the people openly. I guess they figure that somebody's gotta do something. <b>Questioning Jesus' authority in front of the people is a starting place.</b> However, it's hard to go head to head with God incarnate. </p>

In other words, it's a trick question.<b> If they make an admission that John the Baptist is indeed the prophet of Malachi, then the Messiahship of Jesus is the logical conclusion. Of course they decline to answer by saying &quot;We don't know.&quot;</b> Hey! They were poll-driven leaders; they preferred to be the <b>stoners</b> rather than the <b>stonees</b> (Luke 20:6). They never liked John the Baptist, but they knew the people did regard him as a prophet, and he proclaimed himself to be the forerunner of the Messiah. Unfortunately for them, John the Baptist and Jesus arrived in the same package - the forerunner and the Messiah.</p>
		<p><b>Then Jesus gives a parable which cuts them to the quick - which only Matthew reports.</b> The obvious beneficiaries to the Kingdom of God under the Messiah have turned out to be uninterested if Jesus is that Messiah. Jesus explains that this Kingdom is not dependent upon their (Jewish leaders) acceptance. God will include people in the Kingdom thought unworthy by these hypocritical Jewish leaders...and they'll be excluded. In other words, <b>these Jewish leaders aren't worthy, but the people they have harassed and belittled...they are.</b> Here's what makes this parable and the explanation by Jesus even more damaging to these Jewish leaders: Those marginalized people (by the Jewish leaders) are listening to this exchange between Jesus and these Messiah-rejecting hypocrites. So, the common Jew who has received the message of the Kingdom of God is likened to the son who first declined his father's request, but changed his mind and accepted. Whereas these Jewish leaders are likened to the son who said he would, but didn't.</p>

34 Now when vintage-time drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit.<br />
35 And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another.<br />
36 Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.<br />
37 Then last of all he sent his son to them, saying, &ldquo;They will respect my son.&rsquo;<br />
38 But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, &ldquo;This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.&rsquo;<br />

40 &para; &ldquo;Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?&rdquo;<br />
41 &para; They said to Him, &ldquo;He will destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will render to him the fruits in their seasons.&rdquo; <br />

		<p>Jesus then seals the disapproval of these Jewish leaders (including the Pharisees) by topping it off with the parable of the wicked husbandmen. <b>These Jewish leaders understand (verse 45) that they are the wicked husbandmen in this parable. </b>They rejected the prophets (the servants) before, and they are rejecting God's own son (the heir) now. <b>He quotes </b><a title="Psalms 118 Summary" href="7-17.html#Confidence" target="_blank">Psalms 118:22-23 (see notes)</a> when he says in verse 42, &quot;Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Have you never read in the Scriptures: &lsquo;The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone. This was the LORD&rsquo;S doing, And it is marvelous in our eyes&rsquo;?&quot; That Psalm is prophesying the rejection of the Messiah there. <b>Yes, the Kingdom of God (the Messianic rule) will not include these wicked Jewish leaders, but rather the common man instead.</b> They're steamed, but are powerless to take Jesus by force because the people have acknowledged Jesus as a prophet. Specifically, the people believed Jesus was the Messiah. Moreover, by speaking this parable and quoting Psalms 118:22-23, Jesus is absolutely proclaiming that he is the promised Messiah...and all the people heard it. The Jewish leaders are outraged, but all three accounts end with the observation that they feared the people and were, thus, powerless to take Jesus by force.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, in Matthew 21:43 we seem to catch a glimpse of the New Testament Believers when Jesus says, &quot;Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it.&quot; The Greek word for &quot;nation&quot; there is &quot;ethnos,&quot; a word generally used to describe Gentiles. Today, God is manifested and glorified through those who have trusted Jesus Christ as Savior - Gentiles and Jews alike.</p>
	<p>Now, is it just me, or does Matthew 21:45 strike you as a little funny also, &quot;Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking of them.&quot; Hey! Guys! What makes you think he's talkin' about you?</p>
	<p>Jesus continues with these parables in <a title="Matthew 22 Summary" href="5-9.html#Wedding" target="_blank">Matthew 22:1-14 (see notes)</a> where he gives the third one in the series.</p>
