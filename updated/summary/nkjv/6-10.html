      <li>Jesus has been removed from Gethsemane and taken for trial after nightfall.</li>
      <li>These trials take place in Jerusalem throughout the night.</li>

58 &para; And after a little while another saw him and said, &ldquo;You also are of them.&rdquo; &para; But Peter said, &ldquo;Man, I am not!&rdquo; <br />

		<p>We see only in John's account an appearance by Jesus before Annas, the former High Priest and father-in-law of the current High Priest, Caiaphas. <b>As an elder statesman, perhaps his purpose was to help his son-in-law build a preliminary case against Jesus in advance of the more public and meaningful appearance before the High Priest himself.</b> The accounts of Luke and John focus on a different aspect of this appearance (false trial) than Matthew and Mark. John and Luke skip telling us about the false witnesses and go straight for the conversation between Caiaphas and Jesus regarding the identity of Jesus. </p>
		<p>John makes an interesting insertion into the record in John 18:14 when he makes reference to a statement made by Caiaphas after Jesus resurrected Lazarus. Feeling threatened by the miracle of that resurrection, John makes reference to what Caiaphas stated to the other Jewish leaders in John 11:49-52, &quot;   And one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, 'You know nothing at all, nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.' Now this he did not say on his own authority; but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.&quot; John is recalling that occasion here.</p>
		<p>Since Jesus was on trial for statements he had made regarding his identity, Luke and John demonstrate to us that Jesus forces Caiaphas to supply those witnesses who heard him make such statements. The witnesses (in the accounts by Matthew and Mark) are feeble at best. Both appearances (before Annas and Caiaphas) take place in the wee hours of the morning, and thus are illegal trials according to contemporary law. Finally, however, Caiaphas asks Jesus directly if he is the Messiah. Mark records the very clear reply by Jesus to Caiaphas in verse 14:62, &quot;Jesus said, 'I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.'&quot; <b>Jesus answers in the affirmative that he is, indeed, the &quot;Christ,&quot; the Son of God.</b> The Greek word for &quot;Christ&quot; is &quot;christos,&quot; and it is the word for &quot;Messiah.&quot; This is the admission they had sought as grounds for his arrest and execution. Since the Old Testament implications of a Messiah include ruling the world, they feel they have all the evidence they need to get a prosecution before a Roman court and a subsequent execution.</p>

    <p>An interesting point arises from the reaction of Caiaphas the High Priest after Jesus declares his Messiahship. <b>Caiaphas tears his priestly clothing</b> (Matthew 26:65). There are many instances of remorse, frustration, sorrow, etc. in the Old and New Testaments when people did such with their clothing. However, notice the command of <a title="Leviticus 21 Summary" href="3-8.html#Bar" target="_blank">Leviticus 21:10 (see notes)</a> regarding the High Priest, &quot;He who is the high priest among his brethren, on whose head the anointing oil was poured and who is consecrated to wear the garments, shall not uncover his head <strong>nor tear his clothes</strong>.&quot; As a matter of fact, of the 40+ instances in scripture where garments were torn in such a fashion, this is the only instance of a High Priest doing so with the official priestly garment. What does that mean? I can only read between the lines on this one. The command is clear in Leviticus 21:10, but the penalty for violation is not specified. <b>It is a fact, however, that the Aaronic priesthood officially came to an end that day as Jesus reinstated the older priesthood, the Melchizedek priesthood, with his death on the cross.</b> <a title="Hebrews 7 Summary" href="11-13.html#Melchisedek" target="_blank">(For more information on the Melchizedek priesthood, click here to see the notes on Hebrews 7.)</a> Coincidence? I don't think so. Incidentally, this takes place early on Nisan 14, the Passover day when Jesus was crucified. Later that day, after Jesus breaths his last breath, a great earthquake takes place that splits that great dividing curtain which separated the Holy Place in the temple from the Most Holy Place (aka Holy of Holies). Matthew records this in <a title="Matthew 27 Summary" href="6-22.html#Curtain" target="_blank">Matthew 27:51-56 (see notes)</a>. That would seem to mark the moment when the high priesthood of Jesus formally begins and that of Caiaphas formally ends.</p>
	<p>Keep in mind, <b>Jesus has not been convicted of any crime at this point.</b> However, that did not stop the extreme physical abuse by the hostile crowd standing around watching the proceedings. The appearances before Annas and Caiaphas take place very early in the morning. One would assume that they are building their case against Jesus to be presented before the entire Sanhedrin as soon as that council can be assembled. By daybreak, the entire Sanhedrin has been assembled, and the case against Jesus has been in the process of being prepared through these preliminary hearings before Annas and Caiaphas which began around 2:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><b>Meanwhile, Peter is hanging with the temple crowd and denying Jesus. </b>John spends more time talking about Peter's denial than he does the actual appearance before the High Priest by Jesus. Could it be that John was that unspecified disciple of John 18:15 who gained entrance to this first trial venue with Peter? As a matter of fact, it was this unspecified disciple (probably John) who helped Peter actually gain entrance into the area of the palace where the trial itself was being held, but Peter is standing over with the palace servants during the trial. We see in Luke's account (verse 61) that Jesus actually looked over at Peter after his third verbal denial. </p>
		<p>You will notice that <b>none of the disciples stood with Jesus at trial; it wasn't just Peter who forsook him.</b> Particular note is taken in all four Gospel accounts of this denial by Peter, probably in view of his adamant assertion earlier that he, above all other disciples, absolutely, positively would not deny Jesus. What marks Peter's denial as particularly noteworthy is the manner in which he finally did so after being repeatedly confronted (Matthew 26:72-74; Mark 14:71). Notice that Mark says that Peter finally &quot;began to curse and swear, 'I do not know this Man of whom you speak!'&quot; The Greek verb there for &quot;curse&quot; is &quot;anathematizo.&quot; It means &quot;to invoke divine harm.&quot; The verb for &quot;swear&quot; is &quot;omnuo&quot; and means &quot;to take an oath.&quot; Literally, Peter swore with an oath a divine curse upon himself if he was not telling the truth about not knowing Jesus. <b>A vow strengthened with a curse...now that's a strong denial!</b></p>
	<p><b>Is that a rooster I hear?</b> Recall the words of Jesus to Peter at the last supper in Luke 22:34, &quot;I tell you, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me.&quot; Just as Jesus had prophesied, Peter had denied Jesus three times.</p>
	<p>Let's add a little additional perspective to this denial. First of all, John was probably that other disciple in John 18:15 who assisted in getting Peter into the area where the trial was being held, so there were two of the disciples there. Jesus had previously asked back in the garden that his disciples be released (<a href="6-6.html#Crowd" title="John 18 Summary" target="_blank">John 18:8, see notes</a>). The others apparently did not attend the trial, but these two disciples did. The distinction here is that Peter was the one who was asked about his relationship with Jesus and issued the denials. Allow me to emphasize once again, none of his disciples actually stood with Jesus at his trial.</p>

		<p>Matthew alludes to it in 27:1, but Luke goes into some detail regarding an appearance before the Sanhedrin on the heels of his trial before Caiaphas in Luke 22:66-71. It is now daylight - probably around 6:00 a.m. Upon being asked directly regarding his identity as the Messiah, Jesus replies in verse 69, &quot;Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.&quot; They're looking for a more direct answer than that, but that will do...CONDEMNED!</p>
