<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">1 &para; 	Praise the LORD!<br />
Oh, give thanks to the LORD, for He is good!<br />
For His mercy endures forever. <br />
2 	Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD?<br />
Who can declare all His praise? <br />
3 	Blessed are those who keep justice,<br />
And he who does righteousness at all times! <br />
4 	Remember me, O LORD, with the favor You have toward Your people.<br />
Oh, visit me with Your salvation, <br />
5 	That I may see the benefit of Your chosen ones,<br />
That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,<br />
That I may glory with Your inheritance. <br />
6 	We have sinned with our fathers,<br />
We have committed iniquity,<br />
We have done wickedly. <br />
7 	Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders;<br />
They did not remember the multitude of Your mercies,<br />
But rebelled by the sea&mdash;the Red Sea. <br />
8 	Nevertheless He saved them for His name&rsquo;s sake,<br />
That He might make His mighty power known. <br />
9 	He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it dried up;<br />
So He led them through the depths,<br />
As through the wilderness. <br />
10 	He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,<br />
And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. <br />
11 	The waters covered their enemies;<br />
There was not one of them left. <br />
12 	Then they believed His words;<br />
They sang His praise. <br />
13 	They soon forgot His works;<br />
They did not wait for His counsel, <br />
14 	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,<br />
And tested God in the desert. <br />
15 	And He gave them their request,<br />
But sent leanness into their soul. <br />
16 	When they envied Moses in the camp,<br />
And Aaron the saint of the LORD, <br />
17 	The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan,<br />
And covered the faction of Abiram. <br />
18 	A fire was kindled in their company;<br />
The flame burned up the wicked. <br />
19 	They made a calf in Horeb,<br />
And worshiped the molded image. <br />
20 	Thus they changed their glory<br />
Into the image of an ox that eats grass. <br />
21 	They forgot God their Savior,<br />
Who had done great things in Egypt, <br />
22 	Wondrous works in the land of Ham,<br />
Awesome things by the Red Sea. <br />
23 	Therefore He said that He would destroy them,<br />
Had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach,<br />
To turn away His wrath, lest He destroy them.<br />
24 	Then they despised the pleasant land;<br />
They did not believe His word, <br />
25 	But complained in their tents,<br />
And did not heed the voice of the LORD. <br />
26 	Therefore He raised His hand in an oath against them,<br />
To overthrow them in the wilderness, <br />
27 	To overthrow their descendants among the nations,<br />
And to scatter them in the lands. <br />
28 	They joined themselves also to Baal of Peor,<br />
And ate sacrifices made to the dead. <br />
29 	Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds,<br />
And the plague broke out among them. <br />
30 	Then Phinehas stood up and intervened,<br />
And the plague was stopped. <br />
31 	And that was accounted to him for righteousness<br />
To all generations forevermore. <br />
32 	They angered Him also at the waters of strife,<br />
So that it went ill with Moses on account of them; <br />
33 	Because they rebelled against His Spirit,<br />
So that he spoke rashly with his lips. <br />
34 	They did not destroy the peoples,<br />
Concerning whom the LORD had commanded them, <br />
35 	But they mingled with the Gentiles<br />
And learned their works; <br />
36 	They served their idols,<br />
Which became a snare to them. <br />
37 	They even sacrificed their sons<br />
And their daughters to demons, <br />
38 	And shed innocent blood,<br />
The blood of their sons and daughters,<br />
Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;<br />
And the land was polluted with blood. <br />
39 	Thus they were defiled by their own works,<br />
And played the harlot by their own deeds. <br />
40 	Therefore the wrath of the LORD was kindled against His people,<br />
So that He abhorred His own inheritance. <br />
41 	And He gave them into the hand of the Gentiles,<br />
And those who hated them ruled over them. <br />
42 	Their enemies also oppressed them,<br />
And they were brought into subjection under their hand. <br />
43 	Many times He delivered them;<br />
But they rebelled in their counsel,<br />
And were brought low for their iniquity. <br />
44 	Nevertheless He regarded their affliction,<br />
When He heard their cry; <br />
45 	And for their sake He remembered His covenant,<br />
And relented according to the multitude of His mercies. <br />
46 	He also made them to be pitied<br />
By all those who carried them away captive. <br />
47 	Save us, O LORD our God,<br />
And gather us from among the Gentiles,<br />
To give thanks to Your holy name,<br />
To triumph in Your praise. <br />
48 	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel<br />
From everlasting to everlasting!<br />
And let all the people say, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;<br />
Praise the LORD! <br />

	<p><font size="3">We don't know who wrote this Psalm, but Israel's history of disobedience is recounted. </font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Look at the passages drawn from in this Psalm:</b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Verse 7: Red Sea - <a title="Exodus 14-15 Summary" href="2-15.html#Pharaoh" target="_blank">Exodus 14-15 (see notes)</a>			<li>Verse 15: The quail - lots and lots of quail - <a title="Numbers 11 Summary" href="3-20.html#Quail" target="_blank">Numbers 11:33 (see notes)</a>		<li>Verse 17: The priest-led rebellion - <a title="Numbers 16 Summary" href="3-23.html#Democracy" target="_blank">Numbers 16 (see notes)</a>			<li>Verse 19: The golden calf - <a title="Exodus 32 Summary" href="2-23.html#Calf" target="_blank">Exodus 32 (see notes)</a>			<li>Verse 28: Women of Moab - <a title="Numbers 25 Summary" href="3-27.html#Women" target="_blank">Numbers 25 (see notes)</a>			<li>Verse 33: Water from the rock - <a title="Numbers 20 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?incr=-1&mo=3&dy=25#Years" target="_blank">Numbers 20 (see notes)</a>
			<li>Verse 37: Sacrifice to devils - <a title="Deuteronomy 32 Summary" href="4-18.html#Song" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 32:17 (see notes)</a>			<li>Verse 38: On top of all these specifics, he mentions human sacrifice to the idols of Canaan. Gods of the Canaanites included El, Baal (Hadad), Dagon and Anat. Instead of eradicating Canaan of the God-hating heathen (verse 34), they &quot;mingled among the heathen, and learned their works (verse 35).</ul>
		<p>Because of all that, we see beginning in verses 40-46 the consequence of their sin; God handed them over to the nations. <b>As a matter of fact, the Book of Judges records repeated cycles of:</b></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Israel turns its back on God (heathen worship).
			<li>Israel falls into subservience to heathen nations.
			<li>Israel experiences great affliction at the hands of these conquering nations.
			<li>Israel cries out to God and repents.
			<li>Israel is delivered by God as they repent.
			<li>Back to # 1
		</ol>
		<p>That was the pattern all through the 300+ years or so covered by the Book of Judges. The plea is in verses 47-48 for restoration.</p>
		<p>Notice the strong language of verse 40, &quot;Therefore the wrath of the LORD was kindled against His people, So that He abhorred His own inheritance.&quot; It is interesting that there are so many Christians today who do not understand the nature of a promise (i.e. covenant) from God. We see that Israel had broken their fellowship with God to the point that God was very, very unhappy with them. As a result, God allowed them to be punished, but he never forsook them. Notice verse 45, &quot;And for their sake He remembered His covenant.&quot; <b>Hey! A covenant is a covenant.</b> Likewise, salvation is a covenant. When Believers break fellowship with God, he chastises them (<a title="Hebrews 12 Summary" href="11-17.html#Chastisement" target="_blank">Hebrews 12:3-17, see notes</a>), but he does not abandon his salvation promise to them. Many refer to this covenant in simplified terminology by declaring, &quot;once saved, always saved (aka OSAS). Sometimes they may create the impression that they believe they are free to sin without consequence. That's simply not the case. GOD CHASTISES DISOBEDIENT BELIEVERS, but he doesn't snatch their salvation from them; it's not in God's nature to violate an unconditional, everlasting covenant. <a title="Trial versus Chastisement" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Trial_vs_chastisement.html" target="_blank">For a better understanding of this Biblical concept, read the article entitled, &quot;Trial versus Chastisement&quot; by clicking here.</a></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Israel's cycle of disobedience (Psalm 107)<br>
				</b></font></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p> <font size="2">1 &para; 	Oh, give thanks to the LORD, for He is good!<br />
For His mercy endures forever. <br />
2 	Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,<br />
Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy, <br />
3 	And gathered out of the lands,<br />
From the east and from the west,<br />
From the north and from the south. <br />
4 	They wandered in the wilderness in a desolate way;<br />
They found no city to dwell in. <br />
5 	Hungry and thirsty,<br />
Their soul fainted in them. <br />
6 	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,<br />
And He delivered them out of their distresses. <br />
7 	And He led them forth by the right way,<br />
That they might go to a city for a dwelling place. <br />
8 	Oh, that men would give thanks to the LORD for His goodness,<br />
And for His wonderful works to the children of men! <br />
9 	For He satisfies the longing soul,<br />
And fills the hungry soul with goodness. <br />
10 	Those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,<br />
Bound in affliction and irons&mdash; <br />
11 	Because they rebelled against the words of God,<br />
And despised the counsel of the Most High, <br />
12 	Therefore He brought down their heart with labor;<br />
They fell down, and there was none to help. <br />
13 	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,<br />
And He saved them out of their distresses. <br />
14 	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,<br />
And broke their chains in pieces. <br />
15 	Oh, that men would give thanks to the LORD for His goodness,<br />
And for His wonderful works to the children of men! <br />
16 	For He has broken the gates of bronze,<br />
And cut the bars of iron in two. <br />
17 	Fools, because of their transgression,<br />
And because of their iniquities, were afflicted. <br />
18 	Their soul abhorred all manner of food,<br />
And they drew near to the gates of death. <br />
19 	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,<br />
And He saved them out of their distresses. <br />
20 	He sent His word and healed them,<br />
And delivered them from their destructions. <br />
21 	Oh, that men would give thanks to the LORD for His goodness,<br />
And for His wonderful works to the children of men! <br />
22 	Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving,<br />
And declare His works with rejoicing. <br />
23 	Those who go down to the sea in ships,<br />
Who do business on great waters, <br />
24 	They see the works of the LORD,<br />
And His wonders in the deep. <br />
25 	For He commands and raises the stormy wind,<br />
Which lifts up the waves of the sea. <br />
26 	They mount up to the heavens,<br />
They go down again to the depths;<br />
Their soul melts because of trouble. <br />
27 	They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,<br />
And are at their wits&rsquo; end. <br />
28 	Then they cry out to the LORD in their trouble,<br />
And He brings them out of their distresses. <br />
29 	He calms the storm,<br />
So that its waves are still. <br />
30 	Then they are glad because they are quiet;<br />
So He guides them to their desired haven. <br />
31 	Oh, that men would give thanks to the LORD for His goodness,<br />
And for His wonderful works to the children of men! <br />
32 	Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people,<br />
And praise Him in the company of the elders. <br />
33 	He turns rivers into a wilderness,<br />
And the watersprings into dry ground; <br />
34 	A fruitful land into barrenness,<br />
For the wickedness of those who dwell in it. <br />
35 	He turns a wilderness into pools of water,<br />
And dry land into watersprings. <br />
36 	There He makes the hungry dwell,<br />
That they may establish a city for a dwelling place, <br />
37 	And sow fields and plant vineyards,<br />
That they may yield a fruitful harvest. <br />
38 	He also blesses them, and they multiply greatly;<br />
And He does not let their cattle decrease. <br />
39 	When they are diminished and brought low<br />
Through oppression, affliction and sorrow, <br />
40 	He pours contempt on princes,<br />
And causes them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way; <br />
41 	Yet He sets the poor on high, far from affliction,<br />
And makes their families like a flock. <br />
42 	The righteous see it and rejoice,<br />
And all iniquity stops its mouth. <br />
43 	Whoever is wise will observe these things,<br />
And they will understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. </font> </p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><font size="3"><b>This Psalm continues with the same theme found in Psalm 106</b> (<a href="#Lesson">see above</a>)<b>.</b> </font>Notice the cycle of disobedience in this Psalm. The author is unknown, but his history of Israel's pattern of disobedience is a vivid picture of God's people disobeying down through the ages.</p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Note the continuous cycle found in this Psalm - four times:</b></font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Israel disobeyed
			<li>God chastised them
			<li>They repented
			<li>God delivered them
		</ul>
		<p>In each of the four cycles of this Psalm, we find the same lesson - worded exactly the same way in verses 8, 15, 21 and 31, <b>&quot;Oh, that men would give thanks to the LORD for His goodness, And for His wonderful works to the children of men!&quot;</b> It is absolutely clear that the Psalmist is saying, <b>&quot;Can't y'all learn this simple lesson!&quot;</b></p>
	<p><b>Isn't it interesting that many individual Believers relive this same cycle over and over again.</b> They disobey; God chastises them, they repent from their disobedience and God delivers them back into fellowship and victorious Christian living once again. One such cycle ought to do it, but many repeat the same process over and over again throughout their lives.</p>
