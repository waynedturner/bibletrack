		<p>Matthew gives some detail regarding the earthquake that had moved the stone away from the opening of the sepulchre and the reaction of the guards when it happened. It's after daybreak on Sunday morning, and the tomb is open. While John just mentions Mary Magdalene in his account, Matthew and Mark mention that Mary (Jesus' aunt) was there also. But Luke reports down in verse 24:10 that there were other women present at the tomb site as well.</p>

<p>Only John includes this. Before actually entering the tomb herself, Mary Magdalene runs to get Peter and John. &quot;The other disciple&quot; (verse 8) is the modest way by which John refers to himself in his gospel (along with the not-so-modest &quot;disciple, whom Jesus loved&quot; in verse 2). It's mildly amusing to me that John wants us to know that he's in better physical condition than Peter - beats him to the tomb. Yup, it's empty all right. The grave clothes are there, but Jesus has checked out.</p>
<p>Up to this point, Jesus has not appeared after his resurrection. Peter and John see evidence of his resurrection, and the Marys have not yet entered into the tomb.</p>

	<p>After her conversation with the two angels, Mary Magdalene gets another surprise. When she turns around, there's Jesus. Not until after a brief conversation does she recognize that she's talking with Jesus. <b>He does instruct her not to cling to him at this point </b>because he has not yet ascended to Heaven. The KJV translates the Greek &quot;aptou&quot; as &quot;touch&quot; while the NKJV translates it as &quot;cling to&quot; here in verse 17. For those who are convinced that the exact word here is important, I quote the renown Greek scholar of the late 19th/early 20th century, A. T. Robertson, when he says in his definitive work entitled &quot;Word Pictures in the New Testament&quot; the following: &quot;Present middle imperative in prohibition with genitive case, meaning 'cease clinging to me' rather than 'Do not touch me.'&quot; Specifically, Jesus had resurrected from &quot;the heart of the earth&quot; (<a href="2-14.html#Sign" title="Matthew 12 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 12:40, see notes</a>), but had not yet ascended to Heaven. This brings up an interesting discussion when coupled with some other New Testament passages.</p>
	<p><b>Consider the following:</b><br>

<ul>
			<li>Ephesians 4:8-10 - Paul takes a little doctrinal detour when he quotes Psalms 68:18 regarding the whereabouts of Christ between the crucifixion and resurrection. He says that Jesus led &quot;captivity captive&quot; or literally &quot;a band of captives&quot; from the lower part of the earth to a place &quot;far above all Heavens&quot; at his resurrection.			<li>Matthew 12:40 - Jesus said he would spend three days AND three night in the heart of the earth (location of hades).			<li>Luke 16:19-31 - Jesus identifies a place called &quot;Abraham's bosom&quot; within eyesight of a place of torment separated by a great gulf.			<li>Luke 23:43 - Jesus tells the thief that got saved that &quot;today&quot; he would join him in &quot;paradise.&quot;			<li>I Peter 3:19 - Jesus preached to the &quot;spirits in prison.&quot;			
			<li>John 20:17 - Jesus tells Mary not to cling to him because he has not yet ascended to &quot;my Father.&quot;			<li>Matthew 27:52-54 - After the resurrection of Jesus, some resurrected saints wander into Jerusalem and appear to many.		</ul>
		<p>Based on these scriptures, it is logical to conclude that the folks saved prior to the resurrection were being held in Hades where Christ showed up after his crucifixion and preached to the inhabitants there. After three days he led &quot;a band of captives&quot; i.e. the saved-prior-to-the-resurrection folks to Heaven with a stop on earth to visit Mary (but she's not to cling to him), at which time some of these traveling-to-Heaven saints wandered into Jerusalem. The next time he appears, it's ok to touch him. <a title="Ephesians 4:1-16 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.com/notes/resource/misc/Paradise.html" target="_blank"><b title="Paradise Relocated">For a complete discussion on the passages listed above, click here to see the article entitled &quot;Paradise Relocated.&quot;</b></a></p>

<p>Luke reports in verse 10 that there are several women who go back to report their findings to the disciples. You mean they thought the women were making this stuff up? Yup - afraid so! Luke reports that Peter went to the tomb to see what the fuss was all about - apparently his second trip of the day, but this time without John. However, even after this second trip, he apparently isn't certain what it all means.</p>
<p>The evidence of their unbelief (verse 11) is the fact that they did not pack up and head for Galilee as they were instructed to do in Mark 16:7 and again in 10. We see in <a href="6-30.html#Jesus" title="Mark 16 Summary" target="_blank">Mark 16:14 (see notes)</a> that Jesus finally has to go to them in Jerusalem where they were gathered.</p>

<p>Matthew gives us a little bit of insight into another issue regarding the resurrection of Jesus. The guards at the tomb are in a little bit of a predicament here; <b>they've lost the body.</b> When you're primary function is to guard something, and you lose it, that's serious. Apparently these were Temple guards - not Roman guards, according to <a href="6-22.html#Careful" title="Matthew 28:65 Summary" target="_blank">Matthew 27:65 (see notes)</a>. That's why they report back to the Jewish leaders for a what-do-we-do-now meeting. Solution: if they will say that they took a snooze at which time the disciples came and stole the body, the Jewish leaders will (1) pay them a bribe for lying and (2) cover for them with the Roman authorities if they are asked. &quot;What a deal!&quot; the guards must have thought, &quot;We don't have to die after all!&quot; Plus, they had a little extra spending money. Matthew wants us to know that this bribe is common knowledge among the Jews (verse 15).</p>

16 But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not know Him. <br />
17 &para; And He said to them, &ldquo;What kind of conversation is this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?&rdquo;<br />
18 &para; Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and have You not known the things which happened there in these days?&rdquo; <br />

20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him. <br />
21 But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened. <br />
22 Yes, and certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us. <br />
23 When they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive. <br />
24 And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.&rdquo; <br />
25 &para; Then He said to them, &ldquo;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!<br />
26 Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?&rdquo;<br />
27 And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. <br />
28 &para; Then they drew near to the village where they were going, and He indicated that He would have gone farther. <br />
29 But they constrained Him, saying, &ldquo;Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.&rdquo; And He went in to stay with them. <br />
30 &para; Now it came to pass, as He sat at the table with them, that He took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. <br />
31 Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him; and He vanished from their sight. <br />
32 &para; And they said to one another, &ldquo;Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?&rdquo; <br />
33 So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, <br />
34 saying, &ldquo;The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&rdquo; <br />
35 And they told about the things that had happened on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread. </font></td>

	<p><strong>Luke covers this account exhaustively.</strong> He records the teaching session by Jesus for these two men (disciples, but not of the eleven). The initial encounter is on the road to Emmaus, a city about six or so miles away from Jerusalem. We see in Luke 24:33 that these two men went back to Jerusalem to report everything that had been told to them by Jesus to the eleven apostles. This appearance takes place on resurrection Sunday as well as the report back to the eleven. It would appear that these two disciples (one was named Cleopas, about whom we know nothing) did not know with whom they were enjoying fellowship until they broke bread with Jesus in verse Luke 24:30. At that point, they realized that they were communing with Jesus.</p>
	<p>One verse in this passage might be easily overlooked with regard to its doctrinal value, Luke 24:27, &quot;And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.&quot; The phrase &quot;beginning with Moses&quot; is particularly significant inasmuch as it is difficult to readily identify which quotation from Moses looks forward to the Messiah. However, it was apparently common knowledge among the Jews in Jesus' day that <a href="4-12.html#Prophet" title="Deuteronomy 18 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 18:15-22 (see notes)</a> was a reference to the anticipated Messiah by Moses himself.

	<p><font color="#cce1ff">.</font>There's one more significant fact that should be emphasized once again here. The two Marys had been instructed in Mark 16:7 (<a href="#Tomb">see above</a>) to tell the disciples to meet Jesus in Galilee. That was to be the first time they would see Jesus. We can only assume that the Marys correctly relayed the message to the disciples, but the disciples did not leave; that's an obvious sign of the unbelief for which Jesus rebukes them in <a href="6-30.html#Jesus" title="Mark 16 Summary" target="_blank">Mark 16:14 (see notes)</a>.</p>
