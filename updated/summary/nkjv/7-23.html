    <p><font size="4"><b>So, what's the deal on Song of Solomon?<br>
				</b></font><font size="3">The title of this book is taken from verse 1. There is no doubt about the author; it's Solomon - identified in the book by name. Let me say, if anyone says they </font>know for sure that Song of Solomon is anything more than love songs written by Solomon, they are engaging in reckless conjecture. Over the years, all the way back, many early church Christian writers have made attempts at giving this book a deeper meaning by allegory. In other words, it was a common practice by such preachers as Calvin, Wesley, Matthew Henry and a host of others to make the female of this book the New Testament church, and the male they made to be Christ. There is no evidence for this allegory whatsoever in scripture. Moreover, various references through the book become very problematic with that kind of an interpretation. Song of Solomon is never quoted in the New Testament. The Expositor's Bible Commentary points out, &quot;There are no references to law, grace, sin, salvation, or prayer. In fact, there is not a single, indisputable reference to Yahweh (special name written LORD in our English Bibles) in the text.&quot;</p>
	<p>In college, at Tennessee Temple University back in the early seventies, all students (myself included) were required to take a course entitled, &quot;Courtship and Marriage.&quot; It was a one-semester course that used Song of Solomon as a guide for...well...courtship and marriage. The course consisted of going through the book verse by verse. Admittedly, some of the discussions of the text were a little uncomfortable in mixed company. However, that class placed this book in its proper context - love poetry by Solomon - nothing more. The book gives a lot of insight into the era, and it also helps us recognize that God is the author of love and sex. Solomon was a very significant figure in Jewish/Christian history, and this book helps us understand more about him.</p>
		<p>Song of Solomon has two main characters, King Solomon (the lover) and his bride (his beloved, the maiden). This poem features an exchange between the two main characters throughout its eight chapters.</p>

	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">1 The song of songs, which is Solomon&rsquo;s. <br />
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p><strong><font size="4">The courtship (Song of Solomon 1:2-3:5)</font></strong></p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">2 	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth&mdash;<br />
For your love is better than wine. <br />
3 	Because of the fragrance of your good ointments,<br />
Your name is ointment poured forth;<br />
Therefore the virgins love you. <br />
4 	Draw me away!<br />
We will run after you.<br />
The king has brought me into his chambers.<br />
We will be glad and rejoice in you.<br />
We will remember your love more than wine.<br />
Rightly do they love you. <br />
5 	I am dark, but lovely,<br />
O daughters of Jerusalem,<br />
Like the tents of Kedar,<br />
Like the curtains of Solomon. <br />
6 	Do not look upon me, because I am dark,<br />
Because the sun has tanned me.<br />
My mother&rsquo;s sons were angry with me;<br />
They made me the keeper of the vineyards,<br />
But my own vineyard I have not kept. <br />
7 	Tell me, O you whom I love,<br />
Where you feed your flock,<br />
Where you make it rest at noon.<br />
For why should I be as one who veils herself<br />
By the flocks of your companions? <br />
8 	If you do not know, O fairest among women,<br />
Follow in the footsteps of the flock,<br />
And feed your little goats<br />
Beside the shepherds&rsquo; tents. <br />
9 	I have compared you, my love,<br />
To my filly among Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots. <br />
10 	Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,<br />
Your neck with chains of gold.<br />
11 	We will make you ornaments of gold<br />
With studs of silver. <br />
12 	While the king is at his table,<br />
My spikenard sends forth its fragrance. <br />
13 	A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me,<br />
That lies all night between my breasts. <br />
14 	My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blooms<br />
In the vineyards of En Gedi. <br />
15 	Behold, you are fair, my love!<br />
Behold, you are fair!<br />
You have dove&rsquo;s eyes. <br />
16 	Behold, you are handsome, my beloved!<br />
Yes, pleasant!<br />
Also our bed is green. <br />
17 	The beams of our houses are cedar,<br />
And our rafters of fir. <br />
2:1 I am the rose of Sharon,<br />
And the lily of the valleys. <br />
2 	Like a lily among thorns,<br />
So is my love among the daughters. <br />
3 	Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods,<br />
So is my beloved among the sons.<br />
I sat down in his shade with great delight,<br />
And his fruit was sweet to my taste. <br />
4 	He brought me to the banqueting house,<br />
And his banner over me was love. <br />
5 	Sustain me with cakes of raisins,<br />
Refresh me with apples,<br />
For I am lovesick. <br />
6 	His left hand is under my head,<br />
And his right hand embraces me. <br />
7 	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,<br />
By the gazelles or by the does of the field,<br />
Do not stir up nor awaken love<br />
Until it pleases. <br />
8 	The voice of my beloved!<br />
Behold, he comes<br />
Leaping upon the mountains,<br />
Skipping upon the hills. <br />
9 	My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.<br />
Behold, he stands behind our wall;<br />
He is looking through the windows,<br />
Gazing through the lattice. <br />
10 	My beloved spoke, and said to me:<br />
&ldquo;Rise up, my love, my fair one,<br />
And come away. <br />
11 	For lo, the winter is past,<br />
The rain is over and gone. <br />
12 	The flowers appear on the earth;<br />
The time of singing has come,<br />
And the voice of the turtledove<br />
Is heard in our land. <br />
13 	The fig tree puts forth her green figs,<br />
And the vines with the tender grapes<br />
Give a good smell.<br />
Rise up, my love, my fair one,<br />
And come away! <br />
14 	&ldquo;O my dove, in the clefts of the rock,<br />
In the secret places of the cliff,<br />
Let me see your face,<br />
Let me hear your voice;<br />
For your voice is sweet,<br />
And your face is lovely.&rdquo; <br />
15 	Catch us the foxes,<br />
The little foxes that spoil the vines,<br />
For our vines have tender grapes. <br />
16 	My beloved is mine, and I am his.<br />
He feeds his flock among the lilies. <br />
17 	Until the day breaks<br />
And the shadows flee away,<br />
Turn, my beloved,<br />
And be like a gazelle<br />
Or a young stag<br />
Upon the mountains of Bether. <br />
3:1 By night on my bed I sought the one I love;<br />
I sought him, but I did not find him. <br />
2 	&ldquo;I will rise now,&rdquo; I said,<br />
&ldquo;And go about the city;<br />
In the streets and in the squares<br />
I will seek the one I love.&rdquo;<br />
I sought him, but I did not find him. <br />
3 	The watchmen who go about the city found me;<br />
I said,<br />
&ldquo;Have you seen the one I love?&rdquo; <br />
4 	Scarcely had I passed by them,<br />
When I found the one I love.<br />
I held him and would not let him go,<br />
Until I had brought him to the house of my mother,<br />
And into the chamber of her who conceived me. <br />
5 	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,<br />
By the gazelles or by the does of the field,<br />
Do not stir up nor awaken love<br />
Until it pleases. <br />

	<p><strong><font size="4">The wedding procession (Song of Solomon 3:6-11)</font></strong></p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">6 	Who is this coming out of the wilderness<br />
Like pillars of smoke,<br />
Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,<br />
With all the merchant&rsquo;s fragrant powders? <br />
7 	Behold, it is Solomon&rsquo;s couch,<br />
With sixty valiant men around it,<br />
Of the valiant of Israel. <br />
8 	They all hold swords,<br />
Being expert in war.<br />
Every man has his sword on his thigh<br />
Because of fear in the night. <br />
9 	Of the wood of Lebanon<br />
Solomon the King<br />
Made himself a palanquin: <br />
10 	He made its pillars of silver,<br />
Its support of gold,<br />
Its seat of purple,<br />
Its interior paved with love<br />
By the daughters of Jerusalem. <br />
11 	Go forth, O daughters of Zion,<br />
And see King Solomon with the crown<br />
With which his mother crowned him<br />
On the day of his wedding,<br />
The day of the gladness of his heart. <br />

Which have come up from the washing,<br />
Every one of which bears twins,<br />
And none is barren among them. <br />
3 	Your lips are like a strand of scarlet,<br />

Twins of a gazelle,<br />

Than all spices! <br />

Is like the fragrance of Lebanon. <br />

Is my sister, my spouse,<br />
A spring shut up,<br />
A fountain sealed. <br />

With pleasant fruits,<br />
Fragrant henna with spikenard, <br />

Calamus and cinnamon,<br />
With all trees of frankincense,<br />
Myrrh and aloes,<br />
With all the chief spices&mdash; <br />
15 	A fountain of gardens,<br />
A well of living waters,<br />
And streams from Lebanon. <br />
16 	Awake, O north wind,<br />
And come, O south!<br />
Blow upon my garden,<br />
That its spices may flow out.<br />
Let my beloved come to his garden<br />
And eat its pleasant fruits. <br />

As a seal upon your arm;<br />
For love is as strong as death,<br />
Jealousy as cruel as the grave;<br />
Its flames are flames of fire,<br />
A most vehement flame. <br />
7 	Many waters cannot quench love,<br />
Nor can the floods drown it.<br />
If a man would give for love<br />
All the wealth of his house,<br />
It would be utterly despised. <br />

	<p>Song of Solomon makes use of metaphors which are used to identify particular portions of the body, and then actions of love making are described using the metaphors. It's masterfully written so as not to seem explicit. It's really quite a fascinating book.</p>
	<p>One more aspect of this Book of our Bible should be considered: Why is it included in the canon of our scripture? First of all, it was written by King Solomon. However, beyond that, let it be noted that it clearly establishes an important principle that might be overlooked in its absence: A sexual relationship between a husband and a wife is not exclusively for the purpose of procreation. Solomon normalizes this husband-wife relationship including intimacy.</p>
