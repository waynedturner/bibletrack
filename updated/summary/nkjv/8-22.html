      2 So it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), that Jeroboam returned from Egypt. <br>
      3 Then they sent for him and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, <br>
      4 &ldquo;Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.&rdquo; <br>
      5 &para; So he said to them, &ldquo;Come back to me after three days.&rdquo; And the people departed. <br>

      10 &para; Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;Thus you should speak to the people who have spoken to you, saying, &ldquo;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us&rsquo;&mdash;thus you shall say to them: &lsquo;My little finger shall be thicker than my father&rsquo;s waist! <br>
      11 And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>

      15 So the king did not listen to the people; for the turn of events was from God, that the LORD might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. <br>
      16 &para; Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying:<br>
&ldquo;What share have we in David?<br>
We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.<br>
Every man to your tents, O Israel!<br>
Now see to your own house, O David!&rdquo; &para; So all Israel departed to their tents. <br>
17 But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah. <br>
18 &para; Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of revenue; but the children of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem. <br>

<p>In our II Chronicles account, we'll see a little more detail about the Southern Kingdom, but almost nothing about the Northern Kingdom of Israel and Jeroboam. That's because II Chronicles was written for the exiles as a recap of the activities of the Southern Kingdom and the lineage of King David. The activities of the Northern Kingdom only get treatment in Chronicles when it has a bearing on the Southern Kingdom.</p>
<p>Well...Rehoboam never had a chance...really. He was Solomon's son and rightful heir to the throne, but Solomon's streak of stubbornness caused God's decree to be passed upon his kingdom after his death back in <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="8-18.html#Solomon" target="_blank">I Kings 11:11 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, 'Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant.'&quot; <b>God told Solomon his kingdom would be split in two after his death because he entertained the pagan gods of his many wives and concubines.</b> When Rehoboam gets the reins of the kingdom, prophetically the split of Solomon's kingdom is a done deal. </p>
<p>It's ironic that the man Solomon had placed in charge of his forced labor, Jeroboam, returns from exile in Egypt and becomes the king of choice for the rebel Northern Kingdom. <a title="I Kings 12 Summary" href="8-20.html#Breaking" target="_blank">I Kings 12:1-15 (see notes)</a> is our parallel account to these events. The fact that Rehoboam rejects the counsel of the older, wiser men and opts rather for the counsel of the younger men really is incidental to the results; God had already said that the nation would split. Notice verse 15, &quot;So the king did not listen to the people; for the turn of events was from God, that the LORD might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.&quot; Rehoboam made a mistake, but God knew he would make that mistake - a mistake that simply facilitated the prophecy against his Dad which had to be fulfilled anyway. Now...two Israel's and two BOAMS - not related, of course.</p>
<p><a name="War"></a><font size="4"><b>Rehoboam's solution: go to war with the Northern Kingdom (II Chronicles 11:1-12)</b></font><br>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">1 Now when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled from the house of Judah and Benjamin one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. <br>
	    2 &para; But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, <br>
	    3 &ldquo;Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, <br>
	    4 &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;You shall not go up or fight against your brethren! Let every man return to his house, for this thing is from Me.&rdquo;|&rsquo;|&rdquo; Therefore they obeyed the words of the LORD, and turned back from attacking Jeroboam. <br>
	    5 &para; So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah. <br>
	    6 And he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, <br>
	    7 Beth Zur, Sochoh, Adullam, <br>
	    8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, <br>
	    9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, <br>
	    10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and Benjamin, fortified cities. <br>
	    11 And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine. <br>
      12 Also in every city he put shields and spears, and made them very strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>I mean it's got to be very disappointing to find a significant portion of your kingdom has slipped away. Rehoboam determines to go to war to get them back - gets together his army of 180,000. God says to him through the prophet Shemaiah, &quot;Don't fight your relatives!&quot; He abandons the war idea. He does, however, determine to fortify his main cities as strongholds against his potential enemies, an action detailed here in II Chronicles 11, but only mentioned in passing in <a title="I Kings 12 Summary" href="8-20.html#Breaking" target="_blank">I Kings 12 (see notes)</a>.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, verse 12 mentions the participation with Judah of the Tribe of Benjamin. Since Judah was the lone tribe that became the Southern Kingdom, it is deducted that part of Benjamin (nearest Jerusalem) integrated into Judah while the remainder went with the Northern Kingdom. <a title="I Kings 12 Summary" href="8-20.html#Two" target="_blank">See notes on I Kings 12:16-24 for more details.</a></p>
	<p>Incidentally, building projects completed were considered benchmarks for a king's success during his tenure. Those are mentioned here, undoubtedly, as an indicator that Rehoboam did have some accomplishments during his reign.</p>

              16 And after the Levites left, those from all the tribes of Israel, such as set their heart to seek the LORD God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers. <br>

So he did at Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And at Bethel he installed the priests of the high places which he had made. <br>
            33 So he made offerings on the altar which he had made at Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had devised in his own heart. And he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and offered sacrifices on the altar and burned incense. </font></td>

		<p>Jeroboam ran all the priests out of the Northern Kingdom (hereafter called Israel); they fled to the Southern Kingdom (hereafter called Judah). Jeroboam is no idiot. He conjectures in <a title="I Kings 12 Summary" href="8-20.html#Religion" target="_blank">I Kings 12:27 (see notes)</a>, &quot;If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.&quot; <b>So, I Kings 12 gives us the solution Jeroboam came up with - resurrect Aaron's golden calf idea; but, for convenience of worship, let's make it two golden calves this time!</b> II Chronicles leaves out the episodes of the evil doings of Israel from this point forward and will follow only the events that take place in Judah, but Israel stuck with their calves and never served the One True God of David after this point.</p>
	<p>Jeroboam put a stop to worship according to the Law of Moses. He ordained his own set of pagan priests to implement the worship of the golden calves.</p>
	<p>With the priests leaving the tribes of the Northern Kingdom and coming to Jerusalem, we see in verse 17 that they contributed to Rehoboam's Southern Kingdom a measure of godliness toward Jehovah. However, as the verse indicates, that only lasted for the first three years...then religious corruption. <strong>By the fifth year of his reign, Rehoboam has turned against the One True God</strong> and we see him being punished by God accordingly in II Chronicles 12:2 (<a href="#Tough">see below</a>).</p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Rehoboam follows Dad's example: Marry often and father many (II Chronicles 11:18-23)</b></font><br>
    </p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><font size="2">18 &para; Then Rehoboam took for himself as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliah the son of Jesse. <br>
	    19 And she bore him children: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham. <br>
	    20 After her he took Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. <br>
	    21 Now Rehoboam loved Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. <br>
	    22 And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maachah as chief, to be leader among his brothers; for he intended to make him king. <br>
      23 He dealt wisely, and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the territories of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city; and he gave them provisions in abundance. He also sought many wives for them. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
	<p>In marrying, Rehoboam  was no contest for Dad - a distant second at best compared to Solomon's combined 1,000 wives and concubines - who knows how many children! So, here's the count: 18 wives, 60 concubines, 28 sons and 60 daughters. So, what exactly was a concubine anyway? <a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="8-18.html#Solomon" target="_blank">(Click here to see information regarding concubines.)</a> In short, a concubine was a second-class wife. She lacked some of the privileges and rights of a full-fledged wife. After Solomon's abuse, it hardly seems worth mentioning again Rehoboam's violation of <a title="Deuteronomy 17 Summary" href="4-12.html#Rules" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 17:17 (see notes)</a>, &quot;Neither shall he multiply wives for himself, lest his heart turn away; nor shall he greatly multiply silver and gold for himself.&quot; The fact is, excessive wives was probably one of Rehoboam's lesser blatant offenses before God during his reign.</p>

      2 And it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD, <br>
      3 with twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and people without number who came with him out of Egypt&mdash;the Lubim and the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians. <br>
      4 And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came to Jerusalem. <br>
      5 &para; Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah, who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have left you in the hand of Shishak.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
      6 &para; So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, &ldquo;The LORD is righteous.&rdquo; <br>
      7 &para; Now when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, &ldquo;They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance. My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. <br>
      8 Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may distinguish My service from the service of the kingdoms of the nations.&rdquo; <br>
      9 &para; So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king&rsquo;s house; he took everything. He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had made. <br>
      10 Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king&rsquo;s house. <br>
      11 And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guard would go and bring them out; then they would take them back into the guardroom. <br>
      12 When he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to destroy him completely; and things also went well in Judah. <br>
      13 &para; Thus King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother&rsquo;s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. <br>
      14 And he did evil, because he did not prepare his heart to seek the LORD. <br>
      15 &para; The acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days. <br>
    16 So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. Then Abijah his son reigned in his place. </font></td>

      23 For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and wooden images on every high hill and under every green tree. <br>
      24 And there were also perverted persons in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. <br>
      25 &para; It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. <br>
      26 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king&rsquo;s house; he took away everything. He also took away all the gold shields which Solomon had made. <br>
      27 Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king&rsquo;s house. <br>
      28 And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards carried them, then brought them back into the guardroom. <br>
      29 &para; Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <br>
      30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days. <br>
    31 So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. His mother&rsquo;s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. Then Abijam his son reigned in his place. </font></td>

<p><b>At some point in his fifth year of reign, Rehoboam turns against God.</b> What's up with that? Shishak, the King of Egypt, heads up a coalition against Judah. God delivers Judah into their hands.<b> After the initial defeat, Rehoboam repents and turns to the One True God for help.</b> Enter: the prophet, Shemaiah; he tells Rehoboam that God will spare Jerusalem...minus the riches his Dad and Grandfather had amassed; Shishak took the riches. It was also Shemaiah back in <a title="I Kings 12 Summary" href="8-20.html#Two" target="_blank">I Kings 12:22-23 (see notes)</a> that had told Rehoboam not to attack Jeroboam. This passage concludes by indicating that the BOAM boys (Jeroboam and Rehoboam) fought and fought and fought during their simultaneous reigns.</p>
<p>Let's pay close attention to the chastening hand of God in this passage as a result of Rehoboam's disobedience. Notice the wording of verse 1, &quot;Now it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself, that <b>he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel along with him.</b>&quot; Now notice verse 2, &quot;...Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, <strong>because they had transgressed against the LORD,</strong>&quot; After their defeat, Shemaiah proclaims in verse 5, &quot;Thus says the LORD: '<strong>You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have left you in the hand of Shishak.'</strong>&quot; The results of the chastisement were reduced after Rehoboam &quot;humbled himself&quot; in verse 12, but it was too late for complete restoration to the circumstances that existed before Rehoboam turned his back on God.</p>

<p>There's a lesson here that is still applicable today regarding chastisement from God. When God intercedes in one's life through chastisement, repentance from disobedience often follows. However, a complete restoration to pre-disobedience status is not always achieved, as was the case with Rehoboam in this passage.
