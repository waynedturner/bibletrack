      2 Then it came to pass, in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel. <br>
      3 &para; And the king of Israel said to his servants, &ldquo;Do you know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, but we hesitate to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?&rdquo; <br>
      4 So he said to Jehoshaphat, &ldquo;Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead?&rdquo; &para; Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, &ldquo;I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.&rdquo; <br>
      5 Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, &ldquo;Please inquire for the word of the LORD today.&rdquo; <br>
      6 &para; Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, &ldquo;Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to fight, or shall I refrain?&rdquo; &para; So they said, &ldquo;Go up, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.&rdquo; <br>
      7 &para; And Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of Him?&rdquo; <br>
      8 &para; So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &ldquo;There is still one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.&rdquo; &para; And Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;Let not the king say such things!&rdquo; <br>
      9 &para; Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, &ldquo;Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly!&rdquo; <br>
      10 &para; The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, having put on their robes, sat each on his throne, at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. <br>
      11 Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself; and he said, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;With these you shall gore the Syrians until they are destroyed.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
      12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, &ldquo;Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the king&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; <br>
      13 &para; Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king. Please, let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak encouragement.&rdquo; <br>
    14 &para; And Micaiah said, &ldquo;As the LORD lives, whatever the LORD says to me, that I will speak.&rdquo; <br>
    15 &para; Then he came to the king; and the king said to him, &ldquo;Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall we refrain?&rdquo; &para; And he answered him, &ldquo;Go and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king!&rdquo; <br>
    16 &para; So the king said to him, &ldquo;How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?&rdquo; <br>
    17 &para; Then he said, &ldquo;I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, &lsquo;These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
    18 &para; And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &ldquo;Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?&rdquo; <br>
    19 &para; Then Micaiah said, &ldquo;Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by, on His right hand and on His left. <br>
    20 And the LORD said, &ldquo;Who will persuade Ahab to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead?&rsquo; So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner. <br>
    21 Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, and said, &ldquo;I will persuade him.&rsquo; <br>
    22 The LORD said to him, &ldquo;In what way?&rsquo; So he said, &ldquo;I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.&rsquo; And the LORD said, &lsquo;You shall persuade him, and also prevail. Go out and do so.&rsquo; <br>
    23 Therefore look! The LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has declared disaster against you.&rdquo; <br>
    24 &para; Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, &ldquo;Which way did the spirit from the LORD go from me to speak to you?&rdquo; <br>
    25 &para; And Micaiah said, &ldquo;Indeed, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide!&rdquo; <br>
    26 &para; So the king of Israel said, &ldquo;Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king&rsquo;s son; <br>
    27 and say, &ldquo;Thus says the king: &lsquo;Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I come in peace.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <br>
    28 &para; But Micaiah said, &ldquo;If you ever return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Take heed, all you people!&rdquo; </font></td>

<p>So, here's Jehoshaphat, the good King of Judah (<a title="II Chronicles 17 Summary" href="8-24.html#Jehoshaphat" target="_blank">according to II Chronicles 17:1-19, see notes</a>), with a massive army, and who does he hang with? Jezebel's husband, Ahab, King of Israel, a man who held the record for wickedness in his day according to <a title="I Kings 16 Summary" href="8-24.html#Ahab" target="_blank">I Kings 16:33 (see notes)</a>. <b>Ahab decides he wants to go to battle with Syria to take back Ramoth in Gilead and asks for Jehoshaphat's help.</b> According to the Jewish historian Josephus (Ant., VIII, xv, 3 ff), King Omri of Israel (<a title="I Kings 16 Summary" href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?mo=08&dy=24#Omri" target="_blank">I Kings 16:21-28, see notes</a>) had lost it to the Syrians. It had been one of Israel's cities of refuge in Gad on the east side of the Jordan (<a title="Joshua 20-21 Summary" href="4-26.html#Time" target="_blank">Joshua 20-21, see notes</a>), and Ahab wants it back. Jehoshaphat tells Ahab, &quot;Call in the prophets so we can get some success probabilities.&quot; If you're a prophet in Israel under Ahab, you better give just &quot;good&quot; prophecies, or Ahab will land you in prison. </p>
<p><b>They're sitting on their thrones listening to Ahab's yes-men prophets when Jehoshaphat gets a little suspicious of these glowing, identical prophesies.</b> One even shows up with props in II Chronicles 18:10 to illustrate his positive-scenario prophecy. Jehoshaphat queries Ahab, &quot;Wonder why all these prophets agree? You got anybody else?&quot; Actually, Jehoshaphat asks specifically, &quot;Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of Him?&quot; Here's the deal: Ahab didn't ordinarily keep a troop of prophets who were Jehovah prophets. Ahab liked prophets who were loyal to his double-calf religion - the religion of the Northern Kingdom. So, Jehoshaphat wonders if there is at least one prophet of the LORD (Jehovah aka Yahweh) available for questioning. Well, as a matter of fact, Ahab does have one, and he keeps in housed in prison. Well, that figures, doesn't it?</p>
<p><b>Ahab describes his Jehovah-loyal prophet to Jehoshaphat, &quot;but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.&quot;</b>  Jehoshaphat's reply to Ahab is interesting here in II Chronicles 18:7, &quot;Let not the king say such things!&quot; In other words, &quot;Hey, Ahab, don't talk like that!&quot; <b>Well, after 400 (false) prophets say &quot;go for it,&quot; the guy in charge of fetching Micaiah, the real prophet from the LORD, from prison warns Micaiah that he should give a favorable prophecy to match that of the 400 prophets which preceded him.</b></p>

						<p><font size="2">When Micaiah explains what he saw taking place in Heaven, he went into great detail.

Elijah had already prophesied to Ahab that he would die (<a title="I Kings 21 Summary" href="8-27.html#Elijah" target="_blank">I Kings 21:17-29, see notes</a>).

		<p>When Micaiah shows up before Ahab and Jehoshaphat, he is asked by Ahab what he should do regarding the battle against the Syrians, Micaiah, with a lack of enthusiasm for being a yes man, says something like, &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah - go for it; you'll be victorious.&quot; Ahab apparently senses some sarcasm or insincerity in his voice and pursues him further - makes him pledge to tell the truth. <b>Okay, Ahab, you asked for it! Micaiah then cuts loose on him with the whole truth and nothing but the truth, &quot;You're gonna die in battle, Ahab!&quot; </b>King Ahab's reply to King Jehoshaphat then is, &quot;See! I told you!&quot; Micaiah goes on to explain in great detail that the other prophets were evil and were sent to intentionally deceive him into believing he would be victorious in battle. Then one of those false prophets, Zedekiah, goes over and smacks Micaiah and subsequently taunts Micaiah by saying, in essence in II Chronicles 18:23, &quot;Hey prophet...I'll bet you didn't see that coming!&quot; Micaiah simply retorts, &quot;You're going to see the day when you'll go into hiding over this episode.&quot; </p>
		<p>So...is Ahab grateful for an honest prophet from the LORD? Naaaaa! &quot;It's back to prison for you, Micaiah, until I return from battle!&quot; replies Ahab. Michaiah cleverly replies in II Chronicles 18:27, &quot;If you ever return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.&quot; In other words Ahab, &quot;You won't be coming back!&quot;</p>
	<p>Even with all of this unfolding before Jehoshaphat's eyes, Ahab gets Jehoshaphat to pitch in to do battle against Syria. Jehoshaphat was the good King of Judah, but he makes a bad decision here to work with Ahab. <b>It makes you wonder what was going through Jehoshaphat's mind; he listened to the prophecy of the good prophet, Micaiah, and makes a decision to participate anyway...remarkable!</b></p>
	<p>By the way, we see another prophet show up to speak with Jehoshaphat in <a href="8-30.html#Jehoshaphat" title="II Chronicles 19 Summary" target="_blank">II Chronicles 19 (see notes)</a> with an addendum to this story. His own prophet, Jehu, delivers the message from God in 19:2, &quot;Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Therefore the wrath of the LORD is upon you.&quot;</p>

Then, a quirky thing happens; a Syrian soldier shoots an arrow at random and hits Ahab - didn't even know he was shooting at the King of Israel. Ahab just couldn't catch a break that day. Boom! He's dead by sunset - didn't even have his king uniform on. <b>It looks as though Micaiah was right!</b> We don't know what happened to Micaiah after that, but I'm guessing it wasn't good. Prophets were often held accountable for bad events as though they were responsible for their cause; it's like blaming the weather man for a hurricane.</p>
	<p><b>Wait! There's more about this passage worth noting in I Kings 22:38,</b> &quot;Then someone washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood while the harlots bathed, according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken.&quot; That's a fulfillment of Elijah's prophecy in<font size="3"> <a title="I Kings 21 Summary" href="8-27.html#Elijah" target="_blank">I Kings 21:19 (see notes)</a> </font>after Naboth was framed and executed, &quot;You shall speak to him, saying, 'Thus says the LORD: &quot;Have you murdered and also taken possession?&quot;' And you shall speak to him, saying, 'Thus says the LORD: <b>&quot;In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick your blood, even yours.&quot;'&quot;</b></p>

<blockquote>
		  <p><font size="2">41 &para; Jehoshaphat the son of Asa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. <br>
		    42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother&rsquo;s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. <br>
		    43 And he walked in all the ways of his father Asa. He did not turn aside from them, doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for the people offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places. <br>
		    44 Also Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. <br>
		    45 &para; Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the might that he showed, and how he made war, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <br>
		    46 And the rest of the perverted persons, who remained in the days of his father Asa, he banished from the land. <br>
		    47 There was then no king in Edom, only a deputy of the king. <br>
		    48 &para; Jehoshaphat made merchant ships to go to Ophir for gold; but they never sailed, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber. <br>
		    49 Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, &ldquo;Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.&rdquo; But Jehoshaphat would not. <br>
		    50 &para; And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place.  <br>

	<p>He was King of Judah. He was a good king before God. He continued on like his Dad in getting rid of the remnant of the male prostitutes in the land. <b>Two bad moves though: first, he formed an alliance with evil Ahab. Second,  he didn't insist that all the &quot;high places&quot; be torn down in Judah. These were the altars to the false gods.</b> He didn't worship them himself, but he didn't rid Judah of these altars. After losing his fleet of ships, he declined to strike up another commercial venture with Ahab's  son (Ahaziah) in verses 47-49. Jehoshaphat dies, &quot;Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place.&quot;</p>
