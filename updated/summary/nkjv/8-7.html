              8 The poles extended so that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place, in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day. <br>

        <p><b>The Temple is complete.</b> This project began back in <a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/cgi-bin/bible.pl?dy=4&mo=8#Temple" title="I Kings 5/II Chronicles 2 Summary" target="_blank">I Kings 5/II Chronicles 2 (see notes)</a>. Now we need to get the Ark of the Covenant into the new temple. You didn't casually move the Ark of the Covenant on a whim; people have died for such, as was the case with Uzzah <a title="II Samuel 6:1-15 Summary" href="6-15.html#Ark" target="_blank">(II Samuel 6:1-12; I Chronicles 13:1-14, see notes)</a>. </p>
        <p>It's time to kick into action all those musicians David appointed before his death. But first...everybody needs to be consecrated before God. We don't want any moving-the-ark mishaps this time. And so it was done - everybody consecrated who were involved in moving the ark. It's time to transport the Ark to its new home in the Holy of Holies. In order to undertake such an awesome responsibility, they show God their sincerity and willingness to obey with sacrifices, or as I Kings 8:5 says, &quot;...sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.&quot; Now that's a lot of sacrificing; must have worked, though - no deaths are recorded here. We see in II Chronicles 5:11 that all of the priests, regardless of course (<a title="I Chronicles 24 Summary" href="7-13.html#Shift" target="_blank">see notes on I Chronicles 24</a>), were involved in the move. </p>
    <p>And finally, <b>how do you know you've erected a house that God will actually indwell?</b> It's simple; look at II Chronicles 5:13-14. Remember that cloud by day back in the wilderness which represented God's presence? Well, here it is again - inside the new temple. I love it when a plan comes together.<b> It's the Shekinah Glory - filling the new temple!</b>  </p>

		<p><b>Hey! Something's missing here!</b> Look at II Chronicles 5:10, &quot;Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they had come out of Egypt.&quot; The same statement of fact is found in I Kings 8:9. Has anyone seen Aaron's rod and that jar of manna we stuck in the ark back in <a title="Exodus 16 Summary" href="2-16.html#Stuff" target="_blank">Exodus 16:32-34 (see notes)</a>? It appears to be missing now. I suppose somewhere along the way those two items were removed; that's all we know.</p>

<p>Of all the people among whom God could have chosen to dwell, we're it. Of all the places in which God could have had a temple built, this is it. Solomon blesses the people of Jerusalem this day. As he speaks to the people of Israel, he reviews the provisions of the Davidic Covenant proclaiming that Israel is the nation of God and that the throne of David shall endure forever (<a href="6-19.html#Temple" title="II Samuel 7 Summary" target="_blank">II Samuel 7:12-16, see notes</a>). In his presentation, he points out that God had authorized the building of this new temple by David's son, Solomon himself.</p>

      27 then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance. <br>

      29 whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your people Israel, when each one knows his own burden and his own grief, and spreads out his hands to this temple: <br>

      38 and when they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been carried captive, and pray toward their land which You gave to their fathers, the city which You have chosen, and toward the temple which I have built for Your name: <br>

Arise, O LORD God, to Your resting place,<br>
You and the ark of Your strength.<br>
Let Your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation,<br>

Remember the mercies of Your servant David.&rdquo; </font></td>

</font>This is one of those covenant prayers - and a long prayer at that. <b>Solomon is well aware of the fact that Israel has lapses of service to the Lord from time to time; he includes that fact in his prayer of dedication.</b> He also makes an important statement in verse 46 when he prays, &quot;When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin)...&quot; Of course, this is the cornerstone doctrine indicating the need for a Savior. <a title="Romans 3 Summary" href="8-13.html#Jews" target="_blank">Romans 3:23 (see notes)</a> says, &quot;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&quot; <b>It is interesting, though, that Solomon, beginning in verse 46, seems to assume that his people will sin and fall into captivity because of their sin.</b> You will recall back in <a title="Deuteronomy 30 Summary" href="4-17.html" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 30 (see notes)</a> that Moses prophesied that Israel would, indeed, sin and fall into captivity. Solomon includes in his prayer the notion that Israel, after going into captivity, will once again turn back to the Lord; at this point in his prayer he calls upon God to forgive them when they repent while in captivity. </p>
<p>This fall and repentance was all part of the prophecy Moses had given in <a title="Deuteronomy 29 Summary" href="4-16.html#Warn" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 29-30 (see notes)</a>. It's interesting that Solomon simply accepts Moses' prophecy as a given reality, even though it has not taken place yet.<b> I'm guessing that it did not occur to Solomon that his own permission for his wives' pagan idols to be set up on the temple grounds would go a long way toward Israel's moral corruption and ultimate fall as indicated in </b><a title="I Kings 11 Summary" href="8-18.html#Solomon" target="_blank"><b>I Kings 11:1-8 </b>(see notes)</a><b>.</b></p>

  <p><font size="2">54 &para; And so it was, when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication to the LORD, that he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. <br>
    55 Then he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying: <br>
    56 &ldquo;Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He promised. There has not failed one word of all His good promise, which He promised through His servant Moses. <br>
    57 May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers. May He not leave us nor forsake us, <br>
    58 that He may incline our hearts to Himself, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, which He commanded our fathers. <br>
    59 And may these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be near the LORD our God day and night, that He may maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel, as each day may require, <br>
    60 that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no other. <br>
    61 Let your heart therefore be loyal to the LORD our God, to walk in His statutes and keep His commandments, as at this day.&rdquo; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No dedication is complete without a word to the people - a pep talk about doing right and a word of blessing upon the people of Israel. You will note Solomon's statement in verse 56 that God had fulfilled his promise to Israel through Moses inasmuch as they now have rest. This promise to Moses is seen in <a href="4-9.html#Worship" title="Deuteronomy 12 Summary" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 12:9 (see notes)</a>. Israel is to be God's show piece on earth to all the people of the world (verse 60).</p>

</font>Seven days of sacrificing? Whoaaa! They're breaking in the new altar - 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep in 7 days. To make room for the large numbers of sacrifices, the whole middle part of the court in front of the temple was consecrated. </p>
<p>This dedication was combined with the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="http://www.bibletrack.org/notes/resource/misc/Feasts.html" title="Jewish Feasts" target="_blank">see Feasts Table</a>). We see in verse 2 that they were gathered for their regular annual feast. It appears that they actually observed their Feast of Tabernacles for seven days and then the dedication of the new temple for an additional seven days. That clarification is seen when comparing verse 2 here with verses 65-66 and additionally considering the wording of II Chronicles 7:7-8.</p>
